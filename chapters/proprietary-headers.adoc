= Proprietary Headers

This section shares definitions of proprietary headers that should be
named consistently because they address overarching service-related
concerns. Whether services support these concerns or not is optional;
therefore, the OpenAPI API specification is the right place to make this
explicitly visible. Use the parameter definitions of the resource HTTP
methods.

[#183]
== {MUST} Use Only the Specified Proprietary Zalando Headers

As a general rule, proprietary HTTP headers should be avoided. Still
they can be useful in cases where context needs to be passed through
multiple services in an end-to-end fashion. As such, a valid use-case
for a proprietary header is providing context information, which is not
a part of the actual API, but is needed by subsequent communication.

From a conceptual point of view, the semantics and intent of an
operation should always be expressed by URLs path and query parameters,
the method, and the content. Headers are more often used to implement
functions close to the protocol considerations, such as flow control,
content negotiation, and authentication. Thus, headers are reserved for
general context information ({RFC-7231}#section-5[RFC 7231]).

`X-` headers were initially reserved for unstandardized parameters, but the
usage of `X-` headers is deprecated ({RFC-6648}[RFC 6648]). This complicates
the contract definition between consumer and producer of an API following
these guidelines, since there is no aligned way of using those headers.
Because of this, the guidelines restrict which `X-` headers can be used
and how they are used.

The Internet Engineering Task Force's states in {RFC-6648}[RFC 6648] that
company specific header' names should incorporate the organization's name.
We aim for backward compatibility, and therefore keep the `X-` prefix.

The following proprietary headers have been specified by this guideline
for usage so far. Remember that HTTP header field names are not
case-sensitive.

|Header field name |Type |Description |Header field value example

|[[x-flow-id]]{X-Flow-ID}|String|
For more information see <<233>>.
|GKY7oDhpSiKY_gAAAABZ_A

|[[x-tenant-id]]{X-Tenant-ID}|String|
Identifies the tenant initiated the request
to the multi tenant Zalando Platform. The {X-Tenant-ID} must be set 
according to the Business Partner ID extracted from the OAuth token when 
a request from a Business Partner hits the Zalando Platform.

|[[x-sales-channel]]{X-Sales-Channel}|String|
Sales channels are owned by retailers and represent a specific consumer segment
being addressed with a specific product assortment that is offered via CFA
retailer catalogs to consumers (see

|[[c-frontend-type]]{X-Frontend-Type}|String|
Consumer facing applications (CFAs) provide business experience to their
customers via different frontend application types, for instance, mobile app
or browser. Info should be passed-through as generic aspect -- there are
diverse concerns, e.g. pushing mobiles with specific coupons, that make use of
it. Current range is mobile-app, browser, facebook-app, chat-app
|mobile-app

|[[x-device-type]]{X-Device-Type}|String|
There are also use cases for steering customer experience (incl. features and
content) depending on device type. Via this header info should be passed-through
as generic aspect. Current range is smartphone, tablet, desktop, other.
|tablet

|[[x-device-os]]{X-Device-OS}|String|
On top of device type above, we even want to differ between device platform,
e.g. smartphone Android vs. iOS. Via this header info should be passed-through
as generic aspect. Current range is iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, MacOS.
|Android

|[[x-mobile-advertising-id]]{X-Mobile-Advertising-Id}|String|
It is either the 
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager[IDFA] 
(Apple Identifier for mobile Advertising) for iOS, or the 
https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248[GAID] 
(Google mobile Advertising Identifier) for Android. It is a unique, 
customer-resettable identifier provided by mobile device’s operating system 
to faciliate personalized advertising, and usually passed by mobile apps via http header 
when calling backend services. Called services should be ready to pass this 
parameter through when calling other services. It is not sent if the customer 
disables it in the settings for respective mobile platform.

*Exception:* The only exception to this guideline are the conventional
hop-by-hop `X-RateLimit-` headers which can be used as defined in <<153>>.

[#184]
== {MUST} Propagate Proprietary Headers

All Zalando's proprietary headers are end-to-end headers.
footnote:header-types[HTTP/1.1 standard ({RFC-7230}#section-6.1[RFC 7230])
defines two types of headers: end-to-end and hop-by-hop headers. End-to-end
headers must be transmitted to the ultimate recipient of a request or response.
Hop-by-hop headers, on the contrary, are meaningful for a single connection
only.]

All headers specified above must be propagated to the services down the call
chain. The header names and values must remain unchanged.

For example, the values of the custom headers like `X-Device-Type` can affect
the results of queries by using device type information to influence
recommendation results. Besides, the values of the custom headers can influence
the results of the queries (e.g. the device type information influences the
recommendation results).

Sometimes the value of a proprietary header will be used as part of the entity
in a subsequent request. In such cases, the proprietary headers must still be
propagated as headers with the subsequent request, despite the duplication of
information.

[#233]
== {MUST} Support `X-Flow-ID`

The _Flow-ID_ is a generic parameter to be passed through service APIs and
events and written into log files and traces. A consequent usage of the
_Flow-ID_ facilitates the tracking of call flows through our system and allows
the correlation of service activities initiated by a specific call. This is
extremely helpful for operational troubleshooting and log analysis. Main use
case of _Flow-ID_ is to track service calls of our SaaS fashion commerce
platform and initiated internal processing flows (executed synchronously via
APIs or asynchronously via published events).

*Data Definition*

The _Flow-ID_ must be passed through:

* RESTful API requests via {X-Flow-ID} proprietary header (see <<184>>)
* Published events via `flow_id` event field (see <<event-metadata, metadata>>)

It must be an random unique string consisting of maximal 128 chars, restricted
to the character set `[a-zA-Z0-9/+]` (Base64). 

*Note:* If a legacy subsystem can only process _Flow-IDs_ with a specific
format or length, it must define this restrictions in its API specification,
and be generous and remove invalid characters or cut the length to the
supported limit.

*Hint:* In case distributed tracing is supported by {SRE-Tracing}[OpenTracing
(internal link)] you should ensure that created _spans_ are tagged using
`flow_id` — see
{SRE-Tracing}/blob/master/wg-semantic-conventions/best-practices/flowid.md[How
to Connect Log Output with OpenTracing Using Flow-IDs (internal link)] or
{SRE-Tracing}/blob/master/wg-semantic-conventions/best-practices.md[Best
practises (internal link)].

*Service Guidance*

* Services *must* support _Flow-ID_ as generic input, i.e.
** RESTful API endpoints *must* support {X-Flow-ID} header in requests
** Event listeners *must* support the metadata `flow-id` from events.

+
*Note:*  API-Clients *must* provide _Flow-ID_ when calling a service or
producing events. If no _Flow-ID_ is provided in a request or event, the
service must create a new _Flow-ID_.

* Services *must* propagate _Flow-ID_, i.e. use _Flow-ID_ received
with API-Calls or consumed events as...
** input for all API called and events published during processing
** data field written for logging and tracing

*Hint:* This rule also applies to application internal interfaces and events
not published via Nakadi (but e.g. via AWS SQS, Kinesis or service specific
DB solutions).
