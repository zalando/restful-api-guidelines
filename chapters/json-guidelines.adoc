= JSON Guidelines

These guidelines provides recommendations for defining JSON data at Zalando.
JSON here refers to {RFC-7159}[RFC 7159] (which updates {RFC-4627}[RFC 4627]),
the "application/json" media type and custom JSON media types defined for APIs.
The guidelines clarifies some specific cases to allow Zalando JSON data to have
an idiomatic form across teams and services.

The first some of the following guidelines are about property names, the later
ones about values.


[#118]
== {MUST} Property names must be ASCII snake_case (and never camelCase): `^[a-z_][a-z_0-9]*$`

Property names are restricted to ASCII strings. The first
character must be a letter, or an underscore, and subsequent
characters can be a letter, an underscore, or a number.

(It is recommended to use `_` at the start of property names only for keywords like `_links`.)

Rationale: No established industry standard exists, but many popular Internet
companies prefer snake_case: e.g. GitHub, Stack Exchange, Twitter.
Others, like Google and Amazon, use both - but not only camelCase. Itâ€™s
essential to establish a consistent look and feel such that JSON looks
as if it came from the same hand.

[#216]
== {SHOULD} Define Maps Using `additionalProperties`

A "map" here is a mapping from string keys to some other type.
In JSON this is represented as an object, the key-value pairs being represented
by property names and property values.
In OpenAPI schema (as well as in JSON schema) they should be represented using
additionalProperties with a schema defining the value type. Such an object should normally
have no other defined properties.

The map keys don't count as property names in the sense of <<118,rule 118>>, and can
follow whatever format is natural for their domain. Please document this in the description
of the map object's schema.

Here is an example for such a map definition (the `translations` property):

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Message:
      description:
        A message together with translations in several languages.
      type: object
      properties:
        message_key:
          type: string
          description: The message key.
        translations:
          description:
            The translations of this message into several languages.
            The keys are [IETF BCP-47 language tags](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47).
          type: object
          additionalProperties:
            type: string
            description:
              the translation of this message into the language identified by the key.
```

An actual JSON object described by this might then look like this:
```json
{ "message_key": "color",
  "translations": {
    "de": "Farbe",
    "en-US": "color",
    "en-GB": "colour",
    "eo": "koloro",
    "nl": "kleur"
  }
}
```


[#120]
== {SHOULD} Array names should be pluralized

To indicate they contain multiple values prefer to pluralize array
names. This implies that object names should in turn be singular.


[#122]
== {MUST} Boolean property values must not be null

Schema based JSON properties that are by design booleans must not be
presented as nulls. A boolean is essentially a closed enumeration of two
values, true and false. If the content has a meaningful null value,
strongly prefer to replace the boolean with enumeration of named values
or statuses - for example accepted_terms_and_conditions with true or
false can be replaced with terms_and_conditions with values yes, no and
unknown.


[#123]
== {MUST} Use same semantics for `null` and absent properties

Open API 3.x allows to mark properties as `required` and as `nullable` to
specify whether properties may be absent (`{}`) or `null` (`{"example":null}`).
If a property is defined to be not `required` and `nullable` (see
<<required-nullable-row-2, 2nd row in Table below>>), this rule demands
that both cases must be handled in the exact same manner by specification.

The following table shows all combinations and whether the examples are
valid:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===========================================
| {CODE-START}required{CODE-END} | {CODE-START}nullable{CODE-END}
| {CODE-START}{}{CODE-END} | {CODE-START}{"example":null}{CODE-END}
| `true`  |`true`   | {NO}  | {YES}
| `false` | `true`  | {YES} | {YES} [[required-nullable-row-2]]
| `true`  |`false`  | {NO}  | {NO}
| `false` |`false`  | {YES} | {NO}
|===========================================

While API designers and implementers may be tempted to assign different
semantics to both cases, we explicitly decide **against** that option, because we
think that any gain in expressiveness is far outweighed by the risk of clients
not understanding and implementing the subtle differences incorrectly.

As an example, an API that provides the ability for different users to
coordinate on a time schedule, e.g. a meeting, may have a resource for options
in which every user has to make a `choice`. The difference between _undecided_
and _decided against any of the options_ could be modeled as _absent_ and
`null` respectively. It would be safer to express the `null` case with a
dedicated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern[Null object], e.g.
`{}` compared to `{"id":"42"}`.

Moreover, many major libraries have somewhere between little to no support for
a `null`/absent pattern (see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48465005/gson-distinguish-null-value-field-and-missing-field[Gson],
https://github.com/square/moshi#borrows-from-gson[Moshi],
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/578[Jackson],
https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-javaee8-json-binding-3/[JSON-B]). Especially
strongly-typed languages suffer from this since a new composite type is required
to express the third state. Nullable `Option`/`Optional`/`Maybe` types could be
used but having nullable references of these types completely contradicts their
purpose.

The only exception to this rule is JSON Merge Patch {RFC-7396}[RFC 7396]) which
uses `null` to explicitly indicate property deletion while absent properties are
ignored, i.e. not modified.


[#124]
== {SHOULD} Empty array values should not be null

Empty array values can unambiguously be represented as the empty list, `[]`.


[#125]
== {SHOULD} Enumerations should be represented as Strings

Strings are a reasonable target for values that are by design enumerations.


[#235]
== {SHOULD} Name date/time properties using the `_at` suffix

Dates and date-time properties should end with `_at` to distinguish them from
boolean properties which otherwise would have very similar or even identical
names:

- {created_at} rather than {created},
- {modified_at} rather than {modified},
- `occurred_at` rather than `occurred`, and
- `returned_at` rather than `returned`.

**Note:** {created} and {modified} were mentioned in an earlier version of the
guideline and are therefore still accepted for APIs that predate this rule.


[#126]
== {SHOULD} Date property values should conform to RFC 3339

Use the date and time formats defined by {RFC-3339}#section-5.6[RFC 3339]:

* for "date" use strings matching
`date-fullyear "-" date-month "-" date-mday`, for example: `2015-05-28`
* for "date-time" use strings matching `full-date "T" full-time`, for
example `2015-05-28T14:07:17Z`

Note that the
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#data-types[OpenAPI
format] "date-time" corresponds to "date-time" in the RFC) and
`2015-05-28` for a date (note that the OpenAPI format "date" corresponds
to "full-date" in the RFC). Both are specific profiles, a subset of the
international standard {ISO-8601}[ISO 8601].

A zone offset may be used (both, in request and responses) -- this is
simply defined by the standards. However, we encourage restricting dates
to UTC and without offsets. For example `2015-05-28T14:07:17Z` rather
than `2015-05-28T14:07:17+00:00`. From experience we have learned that
zone offsets are not easy to understand and often not correctly handled.
Note also that zone offsets are different from local times that might be
including daylight saving time. Localization of dates should be done by
the services that provide user interfaces, if required.

When it comes to storage, all dates should be consistently stored in UTC
without a zone offset. Localization should be done locally by the
services that provide user interfaces, if required.

Sometimes it can seem data is naturally represented using numerical
timestamps, but this can introduce interpretation issues with precision
- for example whether to represent a timestamp as 1460062925,
1460062925000 or 1460062925.000. Date strings, though more verbose and
requiring more effort to parse, avoid this ambiguity.


[#127]
== {SHOULD} Time durations and intervals could conform to ISO 8601

Schema based JSON properties that are by design durations and intervals
could be strings formatted as recommended by {ISO-8601}[ISO 8601]
({RFC-3339}#appendix-A[Appendix A of RFC 3339 contains a grammar] for
durations).


[#128]
== {MAY} Standards could be used for Language, Country and Currency

* {ISO-3166-1-a2}[ISO 3166-1-alpha2 country]
* (It's "GB", not "UK", even though "UK" has seen some use at Zalando)
* {ISO-639-1}[ISO 639-1 language code]
* {BCP47}[BCP 47] (based on {ISO-639-1}[ISO 639-1])
  for language variants
* {ISO-4217}[ISO 4217 currency codes]
