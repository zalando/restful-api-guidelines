== {SHOULD} reduce bandwidth needs and improve responsiveness

APIs should support techniques for reducing bandwidth based on client needs.
This holds for APIs that (might) have high payloads and/or are used in
high-traffic scenarios like the public Internet and telecommunication networks.
Typical examples are APIs used by mobile web app clients with (often) less
bandwidth connectivity. (DailyPay is a 'Mobile First' company, so be mindful of
this point.)

Common techniques include:

* compression of request and response bodies (see <<156>>) 
* querying field filters to retrieve a subset of resource attributes (see
  <<157>> below)
* {ETag} and {If-Match}/{If-None-Match} headers to avoid re-fetching of
  unchanged resources (see <<182>>)
* {Prefer} header with `return=minimal` or `respond-async` to anticipate reduced
  processing requirements of clients (see <<181>>)
* <<pagination>> for incremental access of larger collections of data items
* caching of master data items, i.e. resources that change rarely or not
  at all after creation (see <<227>>).

Each of these items is described in greater detail below.


[#156]
== {SHOULD} use `gzip` compression

Compress the payload of your API’s responses with gzip, unless there’s a good
reason not to — for example, you are serving so many requests that the time to
compress becomes a bottleneck. This helps to transport data faster over the
network (fewer bytes) and makes frontends respond faster.

Though gzip compression might be the default choice for server payload, the
server should also support payload without compression and its client control
via {Accept-Encoding} request header -- see also {RFC-7231}#section-5.3.4[RFC
7231 Section 5.3.4]. The server should indicate used gzip compression via the
{Content-Encoding} header.


[#157]
== {SHOULD} support partial responses via filtering

Depending on your use case and payload size, you can significantly reduce
network bandwidth need by supporting filtering of returned entity fields.
Here, the client can explicitly determine the subset of fields he wants to
receive via the {fields} query parameter. (It is analogue to
https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fields[GraphQL `fields`] and simple
queries, and also applied, for instance, for
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/how-tos/performance#partial-response[Google
Cloud API's partial responses].)

The {fields} query parameter determines the fields returned with the response
payload object. For instance, `(name)` returns `users` root object with only
the `name` field, and `(name,friends(name))` returns the `name` and the nested
`friends` object with only its `name` field.

OpenAPI doesn't support you in formally specifying different return object
schemes depending on a parameter. When you define the field parameter, we
recommend to provide the following description: `Endpoint supports filtering
of return object fields as described in
[Rule #157](https://opensource.dailypay.com/restful-api-guidelines/#157)`

The syntax of the query {fields} value is defined by the following
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form[BNF] grammar.

[source,bnf]
----
<fields>            ::= [ <negation> ] <fields_struct>
<fields_struct>     ::= "(" <field_items> ")"
<field_items>       ::= <field> [ "," <field_items> ]
<field>             ::= <field_name> | <fields_substruct>
<fields_substruct>  ::= <field_name> <fields_struct>
<field_name>        ::= <dash_letter_digit> [ <field_name> ] 
<dash_letter_digit> ::= <dash> | <letter> | <digit>
<dash>              ::= "-" | "_"
<letter>            ::= "A" | ... | "Z" | "a" | ... | "z"
<digit>             ::= "0" | ... | "9"
<negation>          ::= "!"
----

**Note:** Following the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment[principle of
least astonishment], you should not define the {fields} query parameter using
a default value, as the result is counter-intuitive and very likely not
anticipated by the consumer.


[#158]
== {SHOULD} allow optional embedding of sub-resources

Embedding related resources (also know as _Resource expansion_) is a
great way to reduce the number of requests. In cases where clients know
upfront that they need some related resources they can instruct the
server to prefetch that data eagerly. Whether this is optimized on the
server, e.g. a database join, or done in a generic way, e.g. an HTTP
proxy that transparently embeds resources, is up to the implementation.

See <<137>> for naming, e.g. "embed" for steering of embedded
resource expansion. Please use the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form[BNF] grammar, as
already defined above for filtering, when it comes to an embedding query
syntax.

Embedding a sub-resource can possibly look like this where an order
resource has its order items as sub-resource (/order/\{orderId}/items):

[source,http]
----
GET /order/123?embed=(items) HTTP/1.1

{
  "id": "123",
  "_embedded": {
    "items": [
      {
        "position": 1,
        "sku": "1234-ABCD-7890",
        "price": {
          "amount": 71.99,
          "currency": "EUR"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

[#227]
== {MUST} document cachable `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` endpoints

Caching has to take many aspects into account, e.g. general <<cacheable,
cacheability>> of response information, our guideline to protect endpoints
using SSL and <<104, OAuth authorization>>, resource update and invalidation
rules, existence of multiple consumer instances. As a consequence, caching is
in best case complex, e.g. with respect to consistency, in worst case
inefficient.

As a consequence, client side as well as transparent web caching should be
avoided, unless the service supports and requires it to protect itself, e.g.
in case of a heavily used and therefore rate limited master data service, i.e.
data items that rarely or not at all change after creation.

As default, API providers and consumers should always set the {Cache-Control}
header set to {Cache-Control-no-store} and assume the same setting, if no
{Cache-Control} header is provided.

**Note:** There is no need to document this default setting. However, please
make sure that your framework is attaching this header value by default, or
ensure this manually, e.g. using the best practice of Spring Security as shown
below. Any setup deviating from this default must be sufficiently documented.

[source,http]
----
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0
----

If your service really requires to support caching, please observe the
following rules:

* Document all <<cacheable>> {GET}, {HEAD}, and {POST} endpoints by declaring
  the support of {Cache-Control}, {Vary}, and {ETag} headers in response.
  *Note:* you must not define the {Expires} header to prevent redundant and
  ambiguous definition of cache lifetime. A sensible default documentation of
  these headers is given below.
* Take care to specify the ability to support caching by defining the right
  caching boundaries, i.e. time-to-live and cache constraints, by providing
  sensible values for {Cache-Control} and {Vary} in your service. We will
  explain best practices below.
* [[cache-support-patterns]]Provide efficient methods to warm up and update
  caches, e.g. as follows:
** In general, you should support <<182, `ETag` Together With `If-Match`/
   `If-None-Match` Header>> on all <<cacheable>> endpoints.
** For larger data items support {HEAD} requests or more efficient {GET}
   requests with {If-None-Match} header to check for updates.
** For small data sets provide full collection {GET} requests supporting
   {ETag}, as well as {HEAD} requests or {GET} requests with {If-None-Match}
   to check for updates.
** For medium sized data sets provide full collection {GET} requests supporting
   {ETag} together with <<pagination>> and {entity-tag} filtering {GET} requests
   for limiting the response to changes since the provided {entity-tag}. *Note:*
   this is not supported by generic client and proxy caches on HTTP layer.

*Hint:* For proper cache support, you must return {304} without content on a
failed {HEAD} or {GET} request with  <<182, `If-None-Match: <entity-tag>`>> instead
of {412}.

components:
  headers:
  - Cache-Control:
      description: |
        The RFC 7234 Cache-Control header field is providing directives to
        control how proxies and clients are allowed to cache responses results
        for performance. Clients and proxies are free to not support caching of
        results, however if they do, they must obey all directives mentioned in
        [RFC-7234 Section 5.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234) to the
        word.

        In case of caching, the directive provides the scope of the cache
        entry, i.e. only for the original user (private) or shared between all
        users (public), the lifetime of the cache entry in seconds (max-age),
        and the strategy how to handle a stale cache entry (must-revalidate).
        Please note, that the lifetime and validation directives for shared
        caches are different (s-maxage, proxy-revalidate).

      type: string
      required: false
      example: "private, must-revalidate, max-age=300"

  - Vary:
      description: |
        The RFC 7231 Vary header field in a response defines which parts of
        a request message, aside the target URL and HTTP method, might have
        influenced the response. A client or proxy cache must respect this
        information, to ensure that it delivers the correct cache entry (see
        [RFC-7231 Section
        7.1.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4)).

      type: string
      required: false
      example: "accept-encoding, accept-language"
----

*Hint:* For {ETag} source see <<182>>.

The default setting for {Cache-Control} should contain the `private` directive
for endpoints with standard <<104, OAuth authorization>>, as well as the
`must-revalidate` directive to ensure, that the client does not use stale cache
entries. Last, the `max-age` directive should be set to a value between a few
seconds (`max-age=60`) and a few hours (`max-age=86400`) depending on the change
rate of your master data and your requirements to keep clients consistent.

[source,http]
----
Cache-Control: private, must-revalidate, max-age=300
----

The default setting for {Vary} is harder to determine correctly. It highly
depends on the API endpoint, e.g. whether it supports compression, accepts
different media types, or requires other request specific headers. To support
correct caching you have to carefully choose the value. However, a good first
default may be:

[source,http]
----
Vary: accept, accept-encoding
----

Anyhow, this is only relevant, if you encourage clients to install generic
HTTP layer client and proxy caches.

*Note:* generic client and proxy caching on HTTP level is hard to configure.
Therefore, we strongly recommend to attach the (possibly distributed) cache
directly to the service (or gateway) layer of your application. This relieves
from interpreting the {vary} header and greatly simplifies interpreting the
{Cache-Control} and {ETag} headers. Moreover, is highly efficient with respect
to caching performance and overhead, and allows to support more
<<cache-support-patterns, advanced cache update and warm up patterns>>.

Anyhow, please carefully read {RFC-7234}[RFC 7234] before adding any client or
proxy cache.
