[#148]
== {MUST} Use HTTP Methods Correctly

Be compliant with the standardized HTTP method semantics summarized as follows:


[[get]]
=== GET

{GET} requests are used to *read* either a single or a collection resource.

* {GET} requests for individual resources will usually generate a {404} if the
resource does not exist
* {GET} requests for collection resources may return either {200} (if the
collection is empty) or {404} (if the collection is missing)
* {GET} requests must NOT have a request body payload (see {GET-with-Body})

*Note:* {GET} requests on collection resources should provide sufficient
<<137, filter>> and <<pagination>> mechanisms.


[[get-with-body]]
=== GET with Body

APIs sometimes face the problem, that they have to provide extensive structured
request information with {GET}, that may conflict with the size limits of
clients, load-balancers, and servers. As we require APIs to be standard conform
(body in {GET} must be ignored on server side), API designers have to check the
following two options:

1. {GET} with URL encoded query parameters: when it is possible to encode the
   request information in query parameters, respecting the usual size limits of
   clients, gateways, and servers, this should be the first choice. The request
   information can either be provided via multiple query parameters or by a
   single structured URL encoded string.
2. {POST} with body content: when a {GET} with URL encoded query parameters
   is not possible, a {POST} with body content must be used. In this case the
   endpoint must be documented with the hint {GET-with-Body} to transport the
   {GET} semantic of this call.

*Note:* It is no option to encode the lengthy structured request information
using header parameters. From a conceptual point of view, the semantic of an
operation should always be expressed by the resource names, as well as the
involved path and query parameters. In other words by everything that goes into
the URL. Request headers are reserved for general context information (see
<<183>>). In addition, size limits on query parameters and headers are not
reliable and depend on clients, gateways, server, and actual settings. Thus,
switching to headers does not solve the original problem.

*Hint:* As {GET-with-body} is used to transport extensive query parameters,
the {cursor} cannot any longer be used to encode the query filters in case of
<<160, cursor-based pagination>>. As a consequence, it is best practice to
transport the query filters in the body, while using <<161, pagination links>>
containing the {cursor} that is only encoding the page position and direction.
To protect the pagination sequence the {cursor} may contain a hash over all
applied query filters (See also <<161>>).


[[put]]
=== PUT

{PUT} requests are used to *update* (in rare cases to create) *entire*
resources – single or collection resources. The semantic is best described
as _"please put the enclosed representation at the resource mentioned by
the URL, replacing any existing resource."_.

* {PUT} requests are usually applied to single resources, and not to collection
resources, as this would imply replacing the entire collection
* {PUT} requests are usually robust against non-existence of resources by
implicitly creating before updating
* on successful {PUT} requests, the server will *replace the entire resource*
addressed by the URL with the representation passed in the payload (subsequent
reads will deliver the same payload)
* successful {PUT} requests will usually generate {200} or {204} (if the
resource was updated – with or without actual content returned), and {201} (if
the resource was created)

*Important:* It is best practice to prefer {POST} over {PUT} for creation of
(at least top-level) resources. This leaves the resource ID under control of
the service and allows to concentrate on the update semantic using {PUT} as
follows.

*Note:* In the rare cases where {PUT} is although used for resource creation,
the resource IDs are maintained by the client and passed as a URL path segment.
Putting the same resource twice is required to be <<idempotent>> and to result
in the same single resource instance (see <<149>>).

*Hint:* To prevent unnoticed concurrent updates and duplicate creations when
using {PUT}, you <<182>> to allow the server to react on stricter demands that
expose conflicts and prevent lost updates. See also <<optimistic-locking>> for
details and options.

[[post]]
=== POST

{POST} requests are idiomatically used to *create* single resources on a
collection resource endpoint, but other semantics on single resources endpoint
are equally possible. The semantic for collection endpoints is best described
as _"please add the enclosed representation to the collection resource
identified by the URL"_.

* on a successful {POST} request, the server will create one or multiple new
resources and provide their URI/URLs in the response
* successful {POST} requests will usually generate {200} (if resources have
been updated), {201} (if resources have been created), {202} (if the request
was accepted but has not been finished yet), and exceptionally {204} with
{Location} header (if the actual resource is not returned).

The semantic for single resource endpoints is best described as _"please
execute the given well specified request on the resource identified by the
URL"_.

*Generally:* {POST} should be used for scenarios that cannot be covered by the
other methods sufficiently. In such cases, make sure to document the fact that
{POST} is used as a workaround (see {GET-with-Body}). 

*Note:* Resource IDs with respect to {POST} requests are created and maintained
by server and returned with response payload.

*Hint:* Posting the same resource twice is *not* required to be <<idempotent>>
(check <<149>>) and may result in multiple resources. However, you <<229>> to
prevent this.


[[patch]]
=== PATCH

{PATCH} requests are used to *update parts* of single resources, i.e. where only
a specific subset of resource fields should be replaced. The semantic is best
described as _"please change the resource identified by the URL according to my
change request"_. The semantic of the change request is not defined in the HTTP
standard and must be described in the API specification by using suitable media
types.

* {PATCH} requests are usually applied to single resources as patching entire
collection is challenging
* {PATCH} requests are usually not robust against non-existence of resource
instances
* on successful {PATCH} requests, the server will update parts of the resource
addressed by the URL as defined by the change request in the payload
* successful {PATCH} requests will usually generate {200} or {204} (if
resources have been updated with or without updated content returned)

*Note:* since implementing {PATCH} correctly is a bit tricky, we strongly suggest
to choose one and only one of the following patterns per endpoint, unless
forced by a <<106,backwards compatible change>>. In preference order:

1. use {PUT} with complete objects to update a resource as long as feasible
  (i.e. do not use {PATCH} at all).
2. use {PATCH} with partial objects to only update parts of a resource,
   whenever possible. (This is basically {RFC-7396}[JSON Merge Patch], a
   specialized media type `application/merge-patch+json` that is a partial
   resource representation.)
3. use {PATCH} with {RFC-6902}[JSON Patch], a specialized media type
   `application/json-patch+json` that includes instructions on how to change
   the resource.
4. use {POST} (with a proper description of what is happening) instead of
   {PATCH}, if the request does not modify the resource in a way defined by
   the semantics of the media type.

In practice {RFC-7396}[JSON Merge Patch] quickly turns out to be too limited,
especially when trying to update single objects in large collections (as part
of the resource). In this cases {RFC-6902}[JSON Patch] can shown its full
power while still showing readable patch requests (see also
http://erosb.github.io/post/json-patch-vs-merge-patch[JSON patch vs. merge]).

*Note:* Patching the same resource twice is *not* required to be <<idempotent>>
(check <<149>>) and may result in a changing result. However, you <<229>> to
prevent this.

*Hint:* To prevent unnoticed concurrent updates when using {PATCH} you <<182>>
to allow the server to react on stricter demands that expose conflicts and
prevent lost updates. See <<optimistic-locking>> and <<229>> for details and
options.

[#delete]
=== DELETE

{DELETE} requests are used to *delete* resources. The semantic is best
described as _"please delete the resource identified by the URL"_.

* {DELETE} requests are usually applied to single resources, not on collection
resources, as this would imply deleting the entire collection
* successful {DELETE} requests will usually generate {200} (if the deleted
resource is returned) or {204} (if no content is returned)
* failed {DELETE} requests will usually generate {404} (if the resource cannot
be found) or {410} (if the resource was already deleted before)

*Important:* After deleting a resource with {DELETE}, a {GET} request on the
resource is expected to either return {404} (not found) or {410} (gone)
depending on how the resource is represented after deletion. Under no
circumstances the resource must be accessible after this operation on its
endpoint.


[[head]]
=== HEAD

{HEAD} requests are used to *retrieve* the header information of single
resources and resource collections.

* {HEAD} has exactly the same semantics as {GET}, but returns headers only, no
body.

*Hint:* {HEAD} is particular useful to efficiently lookup whether large
resources or collection resources have been updated in conjunction with the
{ETag}-header.

[[options]]
=== OPTIONS

{OPTIONS} requests are used to *inspect* the available operations (HTTP
methods) of a given endpoint.

* {OPTIONS} responses usually either return a comma separated list of methods
in the `Allow` header or as a structured list of link templates

*Note:* {OPTIONS} is rarely implemented, though it could be used to
self-describe the full functionality of a resource.


[#149]
== {MUST} Fulfill Common Method Properties

Request methods in RESTful services can be...

* [[safe, safe]]{RFC-safe} - the operation semantic is defined to be read-only,
  meaning it must not have _intended side effects_, i.e. changes, to the server
  state.
* [[idempotent, idempotent]]{RFC-idempotent} - the operation has the same
  _intended effect_ on the server state, independently whether it is executed
  once or multiple times. *Note:* this does not require that the operation is
  returning the same response or status code.
* [[cacheable, cacheable]]{RFC-cacheable} - to indicate that responses are
  allowed to be stored for future reuse. In general, requests to safe methods
  are cachable, if it does not require a current or authoritative response
  from the server.

*Note:* The above definitions, of _intended (side) effect_ allows the server
to provide additional state changing behavior as logging, accounting, pre-
fetching, etc. However, these actual effects and state changes, must not be
intended by the operation so that it can be held accountable.

Method implementations must fulfill the following basic properties according
to {RFC-7231}[RFC 7231]:

[cols="15%,15%,35%,35%",options="header",]
|====================================================
| Method    | Safe  | Idempotent | Cacheable
| {GET}     | {YES} | {YES}      | {YES}
| {HEAD}    | {YES} | {YES}      | {YES}
| {POST}    | {NO}  | {AT} No, but <<229>> | {AT} May, but only if specific
{POST} endpoint is <<safe>>. *Hint:* not supported by most caches.
| {PUT}     | {NO}  | {YES}      | {NO}
| {PATCH}   | {NO}  | {AT} No, but <<229>> | {NO}
| {DELETE}  | {NO}  | {YES}      | {NO}
| {OPTIONS} | {YES} | {YES}      | {NO}
| {TRACE}   | {YES} | {YES}      | {NO}
|====================================================

*Note:* <<227>>.

[#229]
== {SHOULD} Consider To Design `POST` and `PATCH` Idempotent

In many cases it is helpful or even necessary to design {POST} and {PATCH}
<<idempotent>> for clients to expose conflicts and prevent resource duplicate
(a.k.a. zombie resources) or lost updates, e.g. if same resources may be
created or changed in parallel or multiple times. To design an <<idempotent>>
API endpoint owners should consider to apply one of the following three
patterns.

* A resource specific *conditional key* provided via <<182,`If-Match` header>>
  in the request. The key is in general a meta information of the resource,
  e.g. a _hash_ or _version number_, often stored with it. It allows to detect
  concurrent creations and updates to ensure <<idempotent>> behavior (see
  <<182>>).
* A resource specific *secondary key* provided as resource property in the
  request body. The _secondary key_ is stored permanently in the resource. It
  allows to ensure <<idempotent>> behavior by looking up the unique secondary
  key in case of multiple independent resource creations from different
  clients (see <<231>>).
* A client specific *idempotency key* provided via {Idempotency-Key} header
  in the request. The key is not part of the resource but stored temporarily
  pointing to the original response to ensure <<idempotent>> behavior when
  retrying a request (see <<230>>).

*Note:* While *conditional key* and *secondary key* are focused on handling
concurrent requests, the *idempotency key* is focused on providing the exact
same responses, which is even a _stronger_ requirement than the <<idempotent,
idempotency defined above>>. It can be combined with the two other patterns.

To decide, which pattern is suitable for your use case, please consult the
following table showing the major properties of each pattern:

[,cols="46%,18%,18%,18%",options="header",]
|==================================================================================
|                               | Conditional Key | Secondary Key | Idempotency Key
| Applicable with                       | {PATCH} | {POST}  | {POST}/{PATCH}
| HTTP Standard                         | {YES}   | {NO}    | {NO}
| Prevents duplicate (zombie) resources | {YES}   | {YES}   | {NO}
| Prevents concurrent lost updates      | {YES}   | {NO}    | {NO} 
| Supports safe retries                 | {YES}   | {YES}   | {YES}
| Supports exact same response          | {NO}    | {NO}    | {YES}
| Can be inspected (by intermediaries)  | {YES}   | {NO}    | {YES}
| Usable without previous {GET}         | {NO}    | {YES}   | {YES}
|==================================================================================

*Note:* The patterns applicable to {PATCH} can be applied in the same way to
{PUT} and {DELETE} providing the same properties.

If you mainly aim to support safe retries, we suggest to apply <<182,
conditional key>> and <<231,secondary key>> pattern before the <<230,
Idempotency Key>> pattern.

[#231]
== {Should} Use Secondary Key for Idempotent `POST` Design

The most important pattern to design {POST} <<idempotent>> for creation is to
introduce a resource specific *secondary key* provided in the request body, to
eliminate the problem of duplicate (a.k.a zombie) resources.

The secondary key is stored permanently in the resource as _alternate key_ or
_combined key_ (if consisting of multiple properties) guarded by a uniqueness
constraint enforced server-side, that is visible when reading the resource.
The best and often naturally existing candidate is a _unique foreign key_, that
points to another resource having _one-on-one_ relationship with the newly
created resource, e.g. a parent process identifier.

A good example here for a secondary key is the shopping cart ID in an order
resource.

*Note:* When using the secondary key pattern without {Idempotency-Key} all
subsequent retries should fail with status code {409} (conflict). We suggest
to avoid {200} here unless you make sure, that the delivered resource is the
original one implementing a well defined behavior. Using {204} without content
would be a similar well defined option.

[#154]
== {MUST} Define Collection Format of Header and Query Parameters

Header and query parameters allow to provide a collection of values, either
by providing a comma-separated list of values or by repeating the parameter
multiple times with different values as follows:

[,cols="14%,30%,39%,17%",options="header",]
|=========================================================================
| Parameter Type | Comma-separated Values | Multiple Parameters | Standard
| Header | `Header: value1,value2` | `Header: value1, Header: value2`
| {RFC-7230}#section-3.2.2[RFC 7230 Section 3.2.2]

| Query | `?param=value1,value2` | `?param=value1&param=value2`
| {RFC-6570}#section-3.2.8[RFC 6570 Section 3.2.8]
|=========================================================================

As Open API does not support both schemas at once, an API specification must
explicitly define the collection format to guide consumers as follows:

[,cols="14%,40%,46%",options="header",]
|===============================================================
| Parameter Type | Comma-separated Values | Multiple Parameters
| Header | `style: simple, explode: false` | not allowed (see
  {RFC-7230}#section-3.2.2[RFC 7230 Section 3.2.2])
| Query  | `style: form, explode: false`   | `style: form, explode: true`
|===============================================================

When choosing the collection format, take into account the tool support,
the escaping of special characters and the maximal URL length.

[#236]
== {SHOULD} Design simple query languages using query parameters

We prefer the use of query parameters to describe resource-specific
query languages for the majority of APIs because it's native to HTTP,
easy to extend and has excellent implementation support in HTTP clients
and web frameworks.

Query parameters should have the following aspects specified:

* Reference to corresponding property, if any
* Value range, e.g. inclusive vs. exclusive
* Comparison semantics (equals, less than, greater than, etc)
* Implications when combined with other queries, e.g. _and_ vs. _or_

How query parameters are named and used is up to individual API designers.
The following examples should serve as ideas:

* `name=Zalando`, to query for elements based on property equality
* `age=5`, to query for elements based on logical properties
**  Assuming that elements don't actually have an `age` but rather a `birthday`
* `max_length=5`, based on upper and lower bounds (`min` and `max`)
* `shorter_than=5`, using terminology specific e.g. to _length_
* `created_before=2019-07-17` or `not_modified_since=2019-07-17`
** Using terminology specific e.g. to time: _before_, _after_, _since_ and _until_

We don't advocate for or against certain names because in the end
APIs should be free to choose the terminology that fits their domain the best.


[#237]
== {SHOULD} Design complex query languages using JSON

Minimalistic query languages based on <<236, query parameters>> are suitable for simple use cases with a small set of available filters that are combined in one way and one way only (e.g. _and_ semantics). Simple query languages are generally preferred over complex ones.

Some APIs will have a need for sophisticated and more complex query languages. Dominant examples are APIs around search (incl. faceting) and product catalogs.

Aspects that set those APIs apart from the rest include but are not limited to:

* Unusual high number of available filters
* Dynamic filters, due to a dynamic and extensible resource model
* Free choice of operators, e.g. `and`, `or` and `not`

APIs that qualify for a specific, complex query language are encouraged to use nested JSON data structures and define them using OpenAPI directly. The provides the following benefits:

* Data structures are easy to use for clients
** No special library support necessary
** No need for string concatenation or manual escaping
* Data structures are easy to use for servers
** No special tokenizers needed
** Semantics are attached to data structures rather than text tokens
* Consistent with other HTTP methods
* API is defined in OpenAPI completely
** No external documents or grammars needed
** Existing means are familiar to everyone

<<json-guidelines, JSON-specific rules>> and most certainly needs to make use of the
<<get-with-body, `GET`-with-body>> pattern.

=== Example

The following JSON document should serve as an idea how a structured query might look like.

[source,json]
----
{
  "and": {
    "name": {
      "match": "Alice"
    },
    "age": {
      "or": {
        "range": {
          ">": 25,
          "<=": 50
        },
        "=": 65
      }
    }
  }
}

[#226]
== {MUST} Document Implicit Filtering

Sometimes certain collection resources or queries will not list all the 
possible elements they have, but only those for which the current client 
is authorized to access.

Implicit filtering could be done on:

* the collection of resources being return on a parent {GET} request
* the fields returned for the resource's detail

In such cases, the implicit filtering must be in the API specification (in its description).

Consider <<227,caching considerations>> when implicitly filtering.

Example:

If an employee of the company _Foo_ accesses one of our business-to-business
service and performs a `{GET} /business-partners`, it must, for legal reasons,
not display any other business partner that is not owned or contractually
managed by her/his company. It should never see that we are doing business
also with company _Bar_.

Response as seen from a consumer working at `FOO`:

[source,json]
----
{
    "items": [
        { "name": "Foo Performance" },
        { "name": "Foo Sport" },
        { "name": "Foo Signature" }
    ]
}
----

Response as seen from a consumer working at `BAR`:

[source,json]
----
{
    "items": [
        { "name": "Bar Classics" },
        { "name": "Bar pour Elle" }
    ]
}
----

The API Specification should then specify something like this:

[source,yaml]
----
paths:
  /business-partner:
    get:
      description: >-
        Get the list of registered business partner.
        Only the business partners to which you have access to are returned.
----
