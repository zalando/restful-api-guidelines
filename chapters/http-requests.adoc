[#148]
== {MUST} Use HTTP Methods Correctly

Be compliant with the standardized HTTP method semantics summarized as
follows:

[[get]]
=== GET

GET requests are used to read a single resource or query set of
resources.

* GET requests for individual resources will usually generate a 404 if
the resource does not exist
* GET requests for collection resources may return either 200 (if the
listing is empty) or 404 (if the list is missing)
* GET requests must NOT have request body payload

*Note:* GET requests on collection resources should provide a sufficient
filter mechanism as well as <<pagination>>.

[[get-with-body]]
=== "GET with Body"

APIs sometimes face the problem, that they have to provide extensive
structured request information with GET, that may even conflicts with
the size limits of clients, load-balancers, and servers. As we require
APIs to be standard conform (body in GET must be ignored on server
side), API designers have to check the following two options:

1.  GET with URL encoded query parameters: when it is possible to encode
the request information in query parameters, respecting the usual size
limits of clients, gateways, and servers, this should be the first
choice. The request information can either be provided distributed to
multiple query parameters or a single structured URL encoded string.
2.  POST with body content: when a GET with URL encoded query parameters
is not possible, a POST with body content must be used. In this case the
endpoint must be documented with the hint `GET with    body` to
transport the GET semantic of this call.

*Note:* It is no option to encode the lengthy structured request
information in header parameters. From a conceptual point of view, the
semantic of an operation should always be expressed by resource name and
query parameters, i.e. what goes into the URL. Request headers are
reserved for general context information, e.g. FlowIDs. In addition,
size limits on query parameters and headers are not reliable and depend
on clients, gateways, server, and actual settings. Thus, switching to
headers does not solve the original problem.

[[put]]
=== PUT

PUT requests are used to create or update *entire* resources - single or
collection resources. The semantic is best described as "_please put the
enclosed representation at the resource mentioned by the URL, replacing
any existing resource._".

* PUT requests are usually applied to single resources, and not to
collection resources, as this would imply replacing the entire
collection
* PUT requests are usually robust against non-existence of resources by
implicitly creating before updating
* on successful PUT requests, the server will *replace the entire
resource* addressed by the URL with the representation passed in the
payload (subsequent reads will deliver the same payload)
* successful PUT requests will usually generate 200 or 204 (if the
resource was updated - with or without actual content returned), and 201
(if the resource was created)

*Note:* Resource IDs with respect to PUT requests are maintained by the
client and passed as a URL path segment. Putting the same resource twice
is required to be idempotent and to result in the same single resource
instance. If PUT is applied for creating a resource, only URIs should be
allowed as resource IDs. If URIs are not available POST should be
preferred.

To prevent unnoticed concurrent updates when using PUT, the combination
of <<182,`ETag` and `If-(None-)Match`>> headers should be considered to signal the server
stricter demands to expose conflicts and prevent lost updates. The section <<optimistic-locking>> also describes some 
alternatives to this approach. 

[[post]]
=== POST

POST requests are idiomatically used to create single resources on a
collection resource endpoint, but other semantics on single resources
endpoint are equally possible. The semantic for collection endpoints is
best described as "_please add the enclosed representation to the
collection resource identified by the URL_". The semantic for single
resource endpoints is best described as "_please execute the given well
specified request on the collection resource identified by the URL_".

* POST request should only be applied to collection resources, and
normally not on single resource, as this has an undefined semantic
* on successful POST requests, the server will create one or multiple
new resources and provide their URI/URLs in the response
* successful POST requests will usually generate 200 (if resources have
been updated), 201 (if resources have been created), and 202 (if the
request was accepted but has not been finished yet)

*More generally:* POST should be used for scenarios that cannot be
covered by the other methods sufficiently. For instance, GET with
complex (e.g. SQL like structured) query that needs to be passed as
request body payload because of the URL-length constraint. In such
cases, make sure to document the fact that POST is used as a workaround.

*Note:* Resource IDs with respect to POST requests are created and
maintained by server and returned with response payload. Posting the
same resource twice is by itself *not* required to be idempotent and may
result in multiple resource instances. Anyhow, if external URIs are
present that can be used to identify duplicate requests, it is best
practice to implement POST in an idempotent way.

[[patch]]
=== PATCH

PATCH requests are only used for partial update of single resources, i.e.
where only a specific subset of resource fields should be replaced. The
semantic is best described as "_please change the resource identified by
the URL according to my change request_". The semantic of the change
request is not defined in the HTTP standard and must be described in the
API specification by using suitable media types.

* PATCH requests are usually applied to single resources, and not on
collection resources, as this would imply patching on the entire
collection
* PATCH requests are usually not robust against non-existence of
resource instances
* on successful PATCH requests, the server will update parts of the
resource addressed by the URL as defined by the change request in the
payload
* successful PATCH requests will usually generate 200 or 204 (if
resources have been updated with or without updated content returned)

*Note:* since implementing PATCH correctly is a bit tricky, we strongly
suggest to choose one and only one of the following patterns per
endpoint, unless forced by a <<106,backwards compatible change>>.
In preference order:

1.  use PUT with complete objects to update a resource as long as
feasible (i.e. do not use PATCH at all).
2.  use PATCH with partial objects to only update parts of a resource,
whenever possible. (This is basically
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396[JSON Merge Patch], a specialized
media type `application/merge-patch+json` that is a partial resource
representation.)
3.  use PATCH with http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON Patch], a
specialized media type `application/json-patch+json` that includes
instructions on how to change the resource.
4.  use POST (with a proper description of what is happening) instead of
PATCH if the request does not modify the resource in a way defined by
the semantics of the media type.

In practice https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396[JSON Merge Patch]
quickly turns out to be too limited, especially when trying to update
single objects in large collections (as part of the resource). In this
cases http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON Patch] can shown its full
power while still showing readable patch requests
(see also http://erosb.github.io/post/json-patch-vs-merge-patch[JSON patch vs. merge]).

To prevent unnoticed concurrent updates when using PATCH, the
combination of <<182,`ETag`and `If-Match`>> headers should be considered to
signal the server stricter demands to expose conflicts and prevent lost updates.

[#delete]
=== DELETE

DELETE requests are used to delete resources. The semantic is best
described as "_please delete the resource identified by the URL_".

* DELETE requests are usually applied to single resources, not on
collection resources, as this would imply deleting the entire collection
* successful DELETE requests will usually generate 200 (if the deleted
resource is returned) or 204 (if no content is returned)
* failed DELETE requests will usually generate 404 (if the resource
cannot be found) or 410 (if the resource was already deleted before)

[[head]]
=== HEAD

HEAD requests are used to retrieve the header information of single
resources and resource collections.

* HEAD has exactly the same semantics as GET, but returns headers only,
no body.

[[options]]
=== OPTIONS

OPTIONS requests are used to inspect the available operations (HTTP methods) of a
given endpoint.

* OPTIONS responses usually either return a comma separated list of
methods in the `Allow` header or as a structured list of link
templates

*Note:* OPTIONS is rarely implemented, though it could be used to
self-describe the full functionality of a resource.

[#149]
== {MUST} Fulfill Safeness and Idempotency Properties

An operation can be...

* idempotent, i.e. operation will have the same effect on the server's state if executed
once or multiple times (note: this does not necessarily mean returning
the same response or status code)
* safe, i.e. must not have side effects such as state changes

Method implementations must fulfill the following basic properties:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=============================
|HTTP method |safe |idempotent
|OPTIONS |Yes |Yes
|HEAD |Yes |Yes
|GET |Yes |Yes
|PUT |No |Yes
|POST |No |No
|DELETE |No |Yes
|PATCH |No |No
|=============================

Please see also https://goo.gl/vhwh8a[Best Practices [internal link]]
for further hints on how to support the different HTTP methods on
resources.

[#154]
== {SHOULD} Explicitly define the Collection Format of Query Parameters

There are different ways of supplying a set of values as a query
parameter. One particular type should be selected and stated explicitly
in the API definition. The OpenAPI property
http://swagger.io/specification/[`collectionFormat`] is used to
specify the format of the query parameter.

Only the `csv` or `multi` formats should be used for multi-value query
parameters as described below.

[,cols="15%,25%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Collection Format |Description |Example
|`csv` |Comma separated values |`?parameter=value1,value2,value3`

|`multi` |Multiple parameter instances
|`?parameter=value1&parameter=value2&parameter=value3`
|=======================================================================

When choosing the collection format, take into account the tool support,
the escaping of special characters and the maximal URL length.

[#226]
== {MUST} Document Implicit Filtering

Sometimes certain collection resources or queries will not list all the 
possible elements they have, but only those for which the current client 
is authorized to access.

Implicit filtering could be done on:

* the list of resources being return on a parent `GET` request
* the fields returned for the resource's detail

In such cases, the implicit filtering must be in the API Specification (in its description).

Consider <<227,caching considerations>> when implicitely filtering.

Example:

If an employee of the company _Foo_ accesses one of our business-to-business
service and performs a `GET /business-partners`, it must, for legal reasons, not display
any other business partner that is not owned or contractually managed by her/his company.
It should never see that we are doing business also with company _Bar_.

Response as seen from a consumer working at `FOO`:

[source,json]
----
{
    "items": [
        { "name": "Foo Performance" },
        { "name": "Foo Sport" },
        { "name": "Foo Signature" }
    ]
}
----

Response as seen from a consumer working at `BAR`:

[source,json]
----
{
    "items": [
        { "name": "Bar Classics" },
        { "name": "Bar pour Elle" }
    ]
}
----

The API Specification should then specify something like this:

[source,yaml]
----
  /business-partner:
    get:
      description: >-
        Get the list of registered business partner.
        Only the business partners to which you have access to are returned.
----
