[#192]
== {MUST} publish OpenAPI specification

All service applications must publish OpenAPI specifications of their external
APIs. While this is optional for internal APIs, i.e. APIs marked with the
*component-internal* <<219, API audience>> group, we still recommend to do so
to profit from the API management infrastructure.

An API is published by copying its *OpenAPI specification* into the reserved
*/dailypay-apis* directory of the *deployment artifact* used to deploy the
provisioning service. The directory must only contain *self-contained YAML*
*files* that each describe one API (exception see <<234>>). We prefer this
deployment artifact-based method over the past (now legacy)
`.well-known/schema-discovery` service endpoint-based publishing process, that
we only support for backward compatibility reasons.

Background: In our dynamic and complex service infrastructure, it is important
to provide API client developers a central place with online access to the API
specifications of all running applications. As a part of the infrastructure,
the API publishing process is used to detect API specifications. The findings
are published in the API Portal - the universal hub for all DailyPay APIs.

*Note:* To publish an API, it is still necessary to deploy the artifact
successful, as we focus the discovery experience on APIs supported by running
services.


[#193]
== {SHOULD} monitor API usage

Owners of APIs used in production should monitor API service to get
information about its using clients. This information, for instance, is
useful to identify potential review partner for API changes.

Hint: A preferred way of client detection implementation is by logging
of the client-id retrieved from the OAuth token.
