[#100]
== {MUST} follow API first principle

You must follow the <<api-first, API First Principle>>, more specifically:

* You must define APIs first, before coding its implementation, <<101, using
  OpenAPI as specification language>>
* You must design your APIs consistently with these guidelines; use our
  {zally-ui}[API Linter Service (internal_link)] 
  for automated rule checks.
* You must call for early review feedback from peers and client developers, and apply 
  {api-review-proc}[our lightweight API review process (internal_link)] 
  for all component external APIs, i.e. all apis 
  with `x-api-audience =/= component-internal` (see <<219>>).


[#101]
== {MUST} provide API specification using OpenAPI

We use the http://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI specification] as standard
to define API specification files. API designers are required to provide the API
specification using a single *self-contained YAML* file to improve readability.
We encourage to use *OpenAPI 3.1* version for new APIs, but our API infrastructure
continues supporting *OpenAPI 3.0* (and *2.0*, aka Swagger 2).

You <<192, must / should publish>> the component <<219, external / internal>>
API specification with the deployment of the implementing service - see 
https://cloud.docs.zalando.net/howtos/api-publishing/[How to publish API Specifications (internal_link)] 
- in order to make it discoverable for the group via 
https://sunrise.zalando.net/apis?group=all[Sunrise (internal_link)] and 
the {api-portal}[API Portal (internal_link)].

The API specification files should be subject to version control using a source
code management system - best together with the implementing sources.

*Hint:* Our API infrastructure does not break, but might not yet fully support all _OpenAPI 3.1 key changes_: 

* _JSON Schema compatibility_: Schema definitions are now fully compatible with 
   standard JSON Schema without OpenAPI-specific overrides.
* _Keyword clean-up_: Keywords like `example`, `nullable`, `discriminator`, `xml`, 
   are removed from the schema object if they are not part of JSON Schema.
* _Webhooks_: Introduction of webhooks as a first-class component.
* _Component reusability_: The components section was expanded with more component 
  types and easier referencing (via the `id` field).

for further change details. 

*Hint:* We do not yet provide guidelines for https://graphql.org/[GraphQL]
and focus on resource oriented HTTP/REST API style (and related tooling 
and infrastructure support).
Following our {techradar-public}[Zalando Tech Radar (internal_link)], we think 
that GraphQL has no major benefits, but a couple of downsides compared to REST 
as API technology for general purpose peer-to-peer microservice communication. 
However, GraphQL can provide a lot of value for specific target domain problems, 
especially backends for frontends (BFF) and mobile clients, where typically 
many (domain object) resources from different services are queried and 
multiple roundtrip overhead should be avoided due to (mobile or public) 
network constraints. Therefore we list both technologies on ADOPT, though 
GraphQL only supplements REST for the BFF-specific problem domain. 


[#102]
== {SHOULD} provide API user manual

In addition to the API Specification, it is good practice to provide an API
user manual to improve client developer experience, especially of engineers
that are less experienced in using this API. A helpful API user manual
typically describes the following API aspects:

* API scope, purpose, and use cases
* concrete examples of API usage
* edge cases, error situation details, and repair hints
* architecture context and major dependencies - including figures and
sequence flows

The user manual must be published online, e.g. via our documentation hosting
platform service, GHE pages, or specific team web servers. Please do not forget
to include a link to the API user manual into the API specification using the
`#/externalDocs/url` property.


[#103]
== {MUST} write APIs using U.S. English


[#234]
== {MUST} only use durable and immutable remote references

Normally, API specification files must be *self-contained*, i.e. files
should not contain references to local or remote content, e.g. `../fragment.yaml#/element` or
`$ref: 'https://github.com/zalando/zally/blob/master/server/src/main/resources/api/zally-api.yaml#/schemas/LintingRequest'`.
The reason is, that the content referred to is _in general_ *not durable* and
*not immutable*. As a consequence, the semantic of an API may change in
unexpected ways. (For example, the second link is already outdated due to code restructuring.)

However, you may use remote references to resources accessible by the following
service URLs:

* `{api-repository} (internal_link)` {dash} used 
  to refer to user-defined, immutable API specification revisions published via the
  internal API repository.
* `https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/{model.yaml}` {dash} used
  to refer to guideline-defined re-usable API fragments (see `{model.yaml}` files in
  https://github.com/zalando/restful-api-guidelines/tree/main/models[restful-api-guidelines/models]
  for details).

*Hint:* The formerly used remote references to the `Problem` API fragment
(aliases `https://opensource.zalando.com/problem/` and
`https://zalando.github.io/problem/`) are deprecated, but still supported for
compatibility (<<176>> on how to replace).

As we control these URLs, we ensure that their content is *durable* and
*immutable*. This allows to define API specifications by using fragments
published via these sources, as suggested in <<151>>.
