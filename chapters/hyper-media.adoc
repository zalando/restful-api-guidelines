== {MUST} Use REST Maturity Level 2

We strive for a good implementation of
http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2[REST
Maturity Level 2] as it enables us to build resource-oriented APIs that
make full use of HTTP verbs and status codes. You can see this expressed
by many rules throughout these guidelines, e.g.:

* <<138>>
* <<141>>
* <<148>>
* <<150>>

Although this is not HATEOAS, it should not prevent you from designing
proper link relationships in your APIs as stated in rules below.

== {MAY} Use REST Maturity Level 3 - HATEOAS

We do not generally recommend to implement
http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level3[REST
Maturity Level 3]. HATEOAS comes with additional API complexity without
real value in our SOA context where client and server interact via REST
APIs and provide complex business functions as part of our e-commerce
SaaS platform.

Our major concerns regarding the promised advantages of HATEOAS (see
also
https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/03/rest-at-odds-with-web-apis[RESTistential
Crisis over Hypermedia APIs],
https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/03/why-i-hate-hateoas/[Why I Hate
HATEOAS] and others for a detailed discussion):

* We follow the <<100,API First principle>>
with APIs explicitly defined outside the code with
standard specification language. HATEOAS does not really add value for
SOA client engineers in terms of API self-descriptiveness: a client
engineer finds necessary links and usage description (depending on
resource state) in the API reference definition anyway.
* Generic HATEOAS clients which need no prior knowledge about APIs and explore
API capabilities based on hypermedia information provided, is a theoretical
concept that we haven't seen working in practice and does not fit to our
SOA set-up. The OpenAPI description format (and tooling based on
OpenAPI) doesn't provide sufficient support for HATEOAS either.
* In practice relevant HATEOAS approximations (e.g. following specifications
like HAL or JSON API) support API navigation by abstracting from URL
endpoint and HTTP method aspects via link types. So, Hypermedia does not
prevent clients from required manual changes when domain model changes
over time.
* Hypermedia make sense for humans, less for SOA machine
clients. We would expect use cases where it may provide value more
likely in the frontend and human facing service domain.
* Hypermedia does not prevent API clients to implement shortcuts and directly
target resources without 'discovering' them.

However, we do not forbid HATEOAS; you could use it, if you checked its
limitations and still see clear value for your usage scenario that
justifies its additional complexity. If you use HATEOAS please share
experience and present your findings in the

[#217]
== {MUST} Use full, absolute URI

Links to other resource must always use full, absolute URI.

*Motivation*: Exposing any form of relative URI (no matter if the relative
URI uses an absolute or relative path) introduces avoidable client side
complexity. It also requires clarity on the base URI, which might not be given
when using features like embedding subresources. The primary advantage
of non-absolute URI is reduction of the payload size, which is better
achievable by following the recommendation to use <<156,gzip compression>>

[#164]
== {MUST} Use Common Hypertext Controls

When embedding links to other resources into representations you must use the
common hypertext control object. It contains at least one attribute:

* [[href]]{href}: The URI of the resource the hypertext control is linking to.
  All our API are using HTTP(s) as URI scheme.

In API that contain any hypertext controls, the attribute name {href} is
reserved for usage within hypertext controls.

The schema for hypertext controls can be derived from this model:

[source,yaml]
----
HttpLink:
  description: A base type of objects representing links to resources.
  type: object
  properties:
    href:
      description: Any URI that is using http or https protocol
      type: string
      format: uri
  required:
    - href
----

The name of an attribute holding such a `HttpLink` object specifies the
relation between the object that contains the link and the linked
resource. Implementations should use names from the {link-relations}[IANA
Link Relation Registry] whenever appropriate. As IANA link relation
names use hyphen-case notation, while this guide enforces snake_case
notation for attribute names, hyphens in IANA names have to be replaced
with underscores (e.g. the IANA link relation type `version-history`
would become the attribute `version_history`)

Specific link objects may extend the basic link type with additional
attributes, to give additional information related to the linked
resource or the relationship between the source resource and the linked
one.

E.g. a service providing "Person" resources could model a person who is
married with some other person with a hypertext control that contains
attributes which describe the other person (`id`, `name`) but also the
relationship "spouse" between the two persons (`since`):

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "446f9876-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
  "name": "Peter Mustermann",
  "spouse": {
    "href": "https://...",
    "since": "1996-12-19",
    "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
    "name": "Linda Mustermann"
  }
}
----

Hypertext controls are allowed anywhere within a JSON model. While this
specification would allow
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL], we actually don't
recommend/enforce the usage of HAL anymore as the structural separation
of meta-data and data creates more harm than value to the
understandability and usability of an API.

[#165]
== {SHOULD} Use Simple Hypertext Controls for Pagination and Self-References

For pagination and self-references a simplified form of the <<164, extensible
common hypertext controls>> should be used to reduce the specification and
cognitive overhead. It consists of a simple URI value in combination with the
corresponding {link-relations}[link relations], e.g. {next}, {prev}, {first},
{last}, or {self}.

See <<simple-hypertext-control-fields>> and <<161>> for examples and more
information.

[#166]
== {MUST} Not Use Link Headers with JSON Entities

For flexibility and precision, we prefer links to be directly embedded in the
JSON payload instead of being attached using the uncommon link header syntax.
As a result, the use of the {RFC-8288}#section-3[`Link` Header defined by RFC
8288] in conjunction with JSON media types is forbidden.
