[#106]
== {MUST} not break backward compatibility

Change APIs, but keep all consumers running. Consumers usually have independent
release lifecycles, focus on stability, and avoid changes that do not provide
additional value. APIs are contracts between service providers and service
consumers that cannot be broken via unilateral decisions.

There are two techniques to change APIs without breaking them:

* follow rules for compatible extensions
* introduce new API versions and still support older versions with 
  https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#deprecation[deprecation]

We strongly encourage using compatible API extensions and discourage versioning
(see <<113>> and <<114>> below). The following guidelines for service providers
(<<107>>) and consumers (<<108>>) enable us (having Postel’s Law in mind) to
make compatible changes without versioning.

*Note:* There is a difference between incompatible and breaking changes.
Incompatible changes are changes that are not covered by the compatibility
rules below. Breaking changes are incompatible changes deployed into operation,
and thereby breaking running API consumers. Usually, incompatible changes are
breaking changes when deployed into operation. However, in specific controlled
situations it is possible to deploy incompatible changes in a non-breaking way,
if no API consumer is using the affected API aspects (see also <<deprecation,
Deprecation>> guidelines).

*Hint:* Please note that the compatibility guarantees are for the "on the wire"
format. Binary or source compatibility of code generated from an API definition
is not covered by these rules. If client implementations update their
generation process to a new version of the API definition, it has to be
expected that code changes are necessary.


[#107]
== {SHOULD} prefer compatible extensions

API designers should apply the following rules to evolve RESTful APIs for
services in a backward-compatible way:

* Add only optional, never mandatory fields.
* Never change the semantic of fields (e.g. changing the semantic from
  customer-number to customer-id, as both are different unique customer keys)
* Input fields may have (complex) constraints being validated via server-side
  business logic. Never change the validation logic to be more restrictive and
  make sure that all constraints are clearly defined in description.
* `enum` ranges can be reduced when used as input parameters, only if the server
  is ready to accept and handle old range values too. The range can be reduced
  when used only as output parameters.
* `enum` ranges cannot be extended when used for output parameters — clients may
  not be prepared to handle it. However, `enum` ranges can be extended when used
  only for input parameters.
* You <<112>> that are used for output parameters and likely to
  be extended with growing functionality. The API definition should be updated
  first before returning new values.
* Consider <<251>> in case a URL has to change.


[#109]
== {SHOULD} design APIs conservatively

Designers of service provider APIs should be conservative and accurate in what
they accept from clients:

* Unknown input fields in payload or URL should not be ignored; servers should
  provide error feedback to clients via an HTTP 400 response code.
  Otherwise, if unexpected fields are planned to be handled in some way instead
  of being rejected, API designers *must* document clearly how unexpected
  fields are being handled for {PUT}, {POST}, and {PATCH} requests.
* Be accurate in defining input data constraints (like formats, ranges, lengths
  etc.) — and check constraints and return dedicated error information in case
  of violations.
* Prefer being more specific and restrictive (if compliant to functional
  requirements), e.g. by defining length range of strings. It may simplify
  implementation while providing freedom for further evolution as compatible
  extensions.

Not ignoring unknown input fields is a specific deviation from Postel's Law
(e.g. see also +
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/8/114933-the-robustness-principle-reconsidered/fulltext[The
Robustness Principle Reconsidered]) and a strong recommendation. Servers might
want to take different approach but should be aware of the following problems
and be explicit in what is supported:

* Ignoring unknown input fields is actually not an option for {PUT}, since it
  becomes asymmetric with subsequent {GET} response and HTTP is clear about the
  {PUT} _replace_ semantics and default roundtrip expectations (see
  {RFC-9110}#section-9.3.4[RFC 9110 Section 9.3.4]). Note, accepting (i.e. not
  ignoring) unknown input fields and returning it in subsequent {GET} responses
  is a different situation and compliant to {PUT} semantics.
* Certain client errors cannot be recognized by servers, e.g. attribute name
  typing errors will be ignored without server error feedback. The server
  cannot differentiate between the client intentionally providing an additional
  field versus the client sending a mistakenly named field, when the client's
  actual intent was to provide an optional input field.
* Future extensions of the input data structure might be in conflict with
  already ignored fields and, hence, will not be compatible, i.e. break clients
  that already use this field but with different type.

In specific situations, where a (known) input field is not needed anymore, it
either can stay in the API definition with "not used anymore" description or
can be removed from the API definition as long as the server ignores this
specific parameter.


[#108]
== {MUST} prepare clients to accept compatible API extensions

Service clients should apply the robustness principle:

* Be conservative with API requests and data passed as input, e.g. avoid to
  exploit definition deficits like passing megabytes of strings with
  unspecified maximum length.
* Be tolerant in processing and reading data of API responses, more
  specifically service clients must be prepared for compatible API extensions
  of response data:

** Be tolerant with unknown fields in the payload (see also Fowler’s
  http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html["TolerantReader"] post),
  i.e. ignore new fields but do not eliminate them from payload if needed for
  subsequent {PUT} requests.
** Be prepared that <<112, extensible enum>> return parameters
  may deliver new values;
  either be agnostic or provide default behavior for unknown values, and
  do not eliminate them when passed to subsequent {PUT} requests.
  (This means you cannot simply implement it by using a limited enumeration type like a Java `enum`.)
** Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint
  definitions. Note also, that status codes are extensible. Default handling is
  how you would treat the corresponding {x00} code (see
  {RFC-9110}#section-15[RFC 9110 Section 15]).
** Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status code {301} (Moved
  Permanently).

The <<handling-compatible-extensions>> section describes a best practice to implement the requirements in Java. 

[#111]
== {MUST} treat OpenAPI specification as open for extension by default

The OpenAPI specification is not very specific on default extensibility
of objects, and redefines JSON-Schema keywords related to extensibility, like
`additionalProperties`. Following our compatibility guidelines, OpenAPI
object definitions are considered open for extension by default as per
http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.5.18[Section
5.18 "additionalProperties"] of JSON-Schema.

When it comes to OpenAPI, this means an `additionalProperties` declaration
is not required to make an object definition extensible:

* API clients consuming data must not assume that objects are closed for
  extension in the absence of an `additionalProperties` declaration and must
  ignore fields sent by the server they cannot process. This allows API
  servers to evolve their data formats.
* For API servers receiving unexpected data, the situation is slightly
  different. According to <<109>>, instead of ignoring fields,
  servers _should_ reject requests whose entities contain undefined fields
  in order to signal to clients that those fields would not be stored on behalf
  of the client.
  Otherwise, if unexpected fields are planned to be handled in some way instead
  of being rejected, API designers *must* document clearly how unexpected
  fields are being handled for {PUT}, {POST}, and {PATCH} requests.

API formats must not declare `additionalProperties` to be false, as this
prevents objects being extended in the future.

Note that this guideline concentrates on default extensibility and does not
exclude the use of `additionalProperties` with a schema as a value, which might
be appropriate in some circumstances, e.g. see <<216>>.


[#113]
== {SHOULD} avoid versioning

When changing your RESTful APIs, do so in a compatible way and avoid generating
additional API versions. Multiple versions can significantly complicate
understanding, testing, maintaining, evolving, operating and releasing our
systems
(http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html[supplementary
reading]).

If changing an API can’t be done in a compatible way, then proceed in one of
these three ways:

* create a new resource (variant) in addition to the old resource variant
* create a new service endpoint — i.e. a new application with a new API (with a
  new domain name)
* create a new API version supported in parallel with the old API by the same
  microservice

As we discourage versioning by all means because of the manifold disadvantages,
we strongly recommend to only use the first two approaches.


[#114]
== {MUST} use media type versioning

However, when API versioning is unavoidable, you have to design your
multi-version RESTful APIs using media type versioning (see <<115>>).
Media type versioning is less tightly coupled since
it supports content negotiation and hence reduces complexity of release
management.

Version information and media type are provided
together via the HTTP `Content-Type` header — e.g.
`application/x.zalando.cart+json;version=2`. For incompatible changes, a new
media type version for the resource is created. To generate the new
representation version, consumer and producer can do <<244, content negotiation>> using
the HTTP `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers.

NOTE: This versioning method only applies to
the request and response payload schema, not to URI or method semantics.

=== Custom media type format

Custom media type format should have the following pattern:

[source,http]
----
application/x.<custom-media-type>+json;version=<version>
----

* `<custom-media-type>` is a custom type name, e.g. `x.zalando.cart`
* `<version>` is a (sequence) number, e.g. `2`

=== Example

In this example, a client wants only the new version of the response:

[source,http]
----
Accept: application/x.zalando.cart+json;version=2
----

A server responding to this, as well as a client sending a request with content
should use the `Content-Type` header, declaring that one is sending the new
version:

[source,http]
----
Content-Type: application/x.zalando.cart+json;version=2
----

Media type versioning should...

* Use a custom media type, e.g. `application/x.zalando.cart+json`
* Include media type versions in request and response headers to increase visibility
* Include `Content-Type` in the `Vary` header to enable proxy caches to differ
  between versions

[source,http]
----
Vary: Content-Type
----

NOTE: Until an incompatible change is necessary, it is recommended to stay
with the standard `application/json` media type without versioning.

Further reading:
https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-versioning-has-no-right-way[API
Versioning Has No "Right Way"] provides an overview on different versioning
approaches to handle breaking changes without being opinionated.


[#115]
== {MUST} not use URL versioning

With URL versioning a (major) version number is included in the path, e.g.
`/v1/customers`. The consumer has to wait until the provider has been released
and deployed. If the consumer also supports hypermedia links — even in their
APIs — to drive workflows (HATEOAS), this quickly becomes complex. So does
coordinating version upgrades — especially with hyperlinked service
dependencies — when using URL versioning. To avoid this tighter coupling and
complexer release management we do not use URL versioning, instead we <<114>>
with content negotiation.


[#110]
== {MUST} always return JSON objects as top-level data structures

In a response body, you must always return a JSON object (and not e.g. an
array) as a top level data structure to support future extensibility. JSON
objects support compatible extension by additional attributes. This allows you
to easily extend your response and e.g. add pagination later, without breaking
backwards compatibility. See <<161>> for an example.

Maps (see <<216>>), even though technically objects, are also forbidden as top
level data structures, since they don't support compatible, future extensions.


[#112]
== {SHOULD} use open-ended list of values (via `examples`) for enumeration types

JSON schema `enum` is per definition a closed set of values that is assumed to be
complete and not intended for extension. This means, extending the list of values of
`enum` is considered an incompatible change, and needs to be aligned with all consumers
like other incompatible changes.

To avoid these issues, we recommend to use `enum` only if

1. the API owner has full control of the enumeration values, i.e. the list of values
  does not depend on any external tool or interface, and
2. the list of values is complete with respect to any thinkable and unthinkable
  future feature.

In all other cases, where additional values are imaginable our recommendation is this:

* Use `examples` with the list of (currently known) values
* Put "Extensible enum" in the description.

This indicates that only the listed values are currently possible, but
consumers need to be aware that this list can be extended without notice
(see below for details).

[source,yaml]
----
delivery_method:
  type: string
  examples:
    - PARCEL
    - LETTER
    - EMAIL
  description: Extensible enum. The chosen delivery method of the invoice.
----

See <<240>> about enum value naming conventions – these apply here too.


**Important**:

* API consumers must be prepared for the fact that also other values can be returned
  with server responses (or be contained in consumed events), and implement a
  fallback / default behavior for unknown new values, see  <<108>>.
* API owners must take care to extend these extensible enums in a compatible way, i.e.
  not changing the semantics of already existing / documented values.
* API implementations should validate the values provided with the input payload and only accept
  values listed in `examples`. The list should not be reduced for inputs (that would be an incompatible change).
* Before additional values are accepted or returned, API owners should update the API description and extend
  the `examples` list, see <<107>>.

(Note that the last 3 bullet points do not apply for uses of `examples` _without_ the
 "Extensible enum." prefix in the description – here any value fitting the rest
 of the schema needs to be expected.)

Note that the plural `examples` on schemas was only introduced with OpenAPI 3.1 (with an update of the JSON schema version referenced).
APIs defined with older OpenAPI versions can't use this format, and instead need to use
the {x-extensible-enum} described below↓.

=== Historic Note: `x-extensible-enum`

Previously (until October 2025) this guideline recommended a proprietary
JSON schema extension {x-extensible-enum} with the same semantic.
The example above would be specified as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
delivery_methods:
  type: string
  x-extensible-enum:
    - PARCEL
    - LETTER
    - EMAIL
  description: The chosen delivery method of the invoice.
----

Until all existing APIs using this have been updated, API providers and consumers
still need to follow the rules under "Important" above for these cases.

This rule originated in the time before JSON schema and OpenAPI schema
had the plural `examples` property (OpenAPI schema had singular `example`,
JSON schema had neither).

The completeness semantic would in theory allow some validation by
intermediaries (but that was rarely implemented).
It was visible in a few tools (e.g. Swagger UI), but ignored by most others.

After the team responsible for Nakadi (our Zalando-internal event bus) decided
to not validate x-extensible-enum, but instead even reject it in event type
definitions, we (the API guideline maintainers) revisited this rule to
recommend `examples` instead.
