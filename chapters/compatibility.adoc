[#106]
== {MUST} Don’t Break Backward Compatibility

Change APIs, but keep all consumers running. Consumers usually have
independent release lifecycles, focus on stability, and avoid changes
that do not provide additional value. APIs are contracts between service
providers and service consumers that cannot be broken via unilateral
decisions.

There are two techniques to change APIs without breaking them:

* follow rules for compatible extensions
* introduce new API versions and still support older versions

We strongly encourage using compatible API extensions and discourage
versioning. The below guideline rules for service providers and
consumers enable us (having Postel’s Law in mind) to make compatible
changes without versioning.

*Hint:* Please note that the compatibility guarantees are for the "on
the wire" format. Binary or source compatibility of code generated from
an API definition is not covered by these rules. If client
implementations update their generation process to a new version of the
API definition, it has to be expected that code changes are necessary.

[#107]
== {SHOULD} Prefer Compatible Extensions

API designers should apply the following rules to evolve RESTful APIs
for services in a backward-compatible way:

* Add only optional, never mandatory fields.
* Never change the semantic of fields (e.g. changing the semantic from
customer-number to customer-id, as both are different unique customer
keys)
* Input fields may have (complex) constraints being validated via
server-side business logic. Never change the validation logic to be more
restrictive and make sure that all constraints a clearly defined in
description.
* Enum ranges can be reduced when used as input parameters, only if the
server is ready to accept and handle old range values too. Enum range
can be reduced when used as output parameters.
* Enum ranges cannot not be extended when used for output parameters —
clients may not be prepared to handle it. However, enum ranges can be
extended when used for input parameters.
* Use <<112,`x-extensible-enum`>>,
if range is used for output parameters and likely to be extended with
growing functionality. It defines an open list of explicit values and
clients must be agnostic to new values.
* Support redirection in case an URL has to change
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301[301 Moved Permanently]).

[#108]
== {MUST} Prepare Clients To Not Crash On Compatible API Extensions

Service clients should apply the robustness principle:

* Be conservative with API requests and data passed as input, e.g. avoid
to exploit definition deficits like passing megabytes for strings with
unspecified maximum length.
* Be tolerant in processing and reading data of API responses, more
specifically...

Service clients must be prepared for compatible API extensions of
service providers:

* Be tolerant with unknown fields in the payload (see also Fowler’s
http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html["TolerantReader"]
post), i.e. ignore new fields but do not eliminate them from payload if
needed for subsequent PUT requests.
* Be prepared that <<112,`x-extensible-enum`>>
return parameter may deliver new values; either be agnostic or provide
default behavior for unknown values.
* Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in
endpoint definitions. Note also, that status codes are extensible.
Default handling is how you would treat the corresponding x00 code (see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6[RFC7231 Section 6]).
* Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301[301 Moved Permanently].

[#109]
== {SHOULD} Design APIs Conservatively

Designers of service provider APIs should be conservative and accurate
in what they accept from clients:

* Unknown input fields in payload or URL should not be ignored; servers
should provide error feedback to clients via an HTTP 400 response code.
* Be accurate in defining input data constraints (like formats, ranges,
lengths etc.) — and check constraints and return dedicated error
information in case of violations.
* Prefer being more specific and restrictive (if compliant to functional
requirements), e.g. by defining length range of strings. It may simplify
implementation while providing freedom for further evolution as
compatible extensions.

Not ignoring unknown input fields is a specific deviation from Postel's
Law (e.g. see also +
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/8/114933-the-robustness-principle-reconsidered/fulltext[The
Robustness Principle Reconsidered]) and a strong recommendation. Servers
might want to take different approach but should be aware of the
following problems and be explicit in what is supported:

* Ignoring unknown input fields is actually not an option for PUT, since
it becomes asymmetric with subsequent GET response and HTTP is clear
about the PUT "replace" semantics and default roundtrip expectations
(see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4[RFC7231 Section
4.3.4]). Note, accepting (i.e. not ignoring) unknown input fields and
returning it in subsequent GET responses is a different situation and
compliant to PUT semantics.
* Certain client errors cannot be recognized by servers, e.g. attribute
name typing errors will be ignored without server error feedback. The
server cannot differentiate between the client intentionally providing
an additional field versus the client sending a mistakenly named field,
when the client's actual intent was to provide an optional input field.
* Future extensions of the input data structure might be in conflict
with already ignored fields and, hence, will not be compatible, i.e.
break clients that already use this field but with different type.

In specific situations, where a (known) input field is not needed
anymore, it either can stay in the API definition with "not used
anymore" description or can be removed from the API definition as long
as the server ignores this specific parameter.

[#110]
== {MUST} Always Return JSON Objects As Top-Level Data Structures To Support Extensibility

In a response body, you must always return a JSON object (and not e.g.
an array) as a top level data structure to support future extensibility.
JSON objects support compatible extension by additional attributes. This
allows you to easily extend your response and e.g. add pagination later,
without breaking backwards compatibility.

[#111]
== {MUST} Treat Open API Definitions As Open For Extension By Default

The Open API 2.0 specification is not very specific on default
extensibility of objects, and redefines JSON-Schema keywords related to
extensibility, like `additionalProperties`. Following our overall
compatibility guidelines, Open API object definitions are considered
open for extension by default as per
http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.5.18[Section
5.18 "additionalProperties"] of JSON-Schema.

When it comes to Open API 2.0, this means an `additionalProperties`
declaration is not required to make an object definition extensible:

* API clients consuming data must not assume that objects are closed for
extension in the absence of an `additionalProperties` declaration and
must ignore fields sent by the server they cannot process. This allows
API servers to evolve their data formats.
* For API servers receiving unxpected data, the situation is slightly
different. Instead of ignoring fields, servers _may_ reject requests
whose entities contain undefined fields in order to signal to clients
that those fields would not be stored on behalf of the client. API
designers must document clearly how unexpected fields are handled for
PUT, POST and PATCH requests.

API formats must not declare `additionalProperties` to be false, as this
prevents objects being extended in the future.

Note that this guideline concentrates on default extensibility and does
not exclude the use of `additionalProperties` with a schema as a value,
which might be appropriate in some circumstances.

[#112]
== {SHOULD} Used Open-Ended List of Values (x-extensible-enum) Instead of Enumerations

Enumerations are per definition closed sets of values, that are assumed
to be complete and not intended for extension. This closed principle of
enumerations imposes compatibility issues when an enumeration must be
extended. To avoid these issues, we strongly recommend to use an
open-ended list of values instead of an enumeration unless:

1.  the API has full control of the enumeration values, i.e. the list of
values does not depend on any external tool or interface, and
2.  the list of value is complete with respect to any thinkable and
unthinkable future feature.

To specify an open-ended list of values use the marker
`x-extensible-enum` as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
deliver_methods:
  type: string
  x-extensible-enum:
    - parcel
    - letter
    - email
----

*Note:* `x-extensible-enum` is not JSON Schema conform but will be
ignored by most tools.

[#113]
== {SHOULD} Avoid Versioning

When changing your RESTful APIs, do so in a compatible way and avoid
generating additional API versions. Multiple versions can significantly
complicate understanding, testing, maintaining, evolving, operating and
releasing our systems
(http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html[supplementary
reading]).

If changing an API can’t be done in a compatible way, then proceed in
one of these three ways:

* create a new resource (variant) in addition to the old resource
variant
* create a new service endpoint — i.e. a new application with a new API
(with a new domain name)
* create a new API version supported in parallel with the old API by the
same microservice

As we discourage versioning by all means because of the manifold
disadvantages, we suggest to only use the first two approaches.

[#114]
== {MUST} Use Media Type Versioning

When API versioning is unavoidable, you have to design your
multi-version RESTful APIs using media type versioning (instead of URI
versioning, see below). Media type versioning is less tightly coupled
since it supports content negotiation and hence reduces complexity of
release management.

Media type versioning: Here, version information and media type are
provided together via the HTTP Content-Type header — e.g.
application/vnd.uk.gov.hmcts.idam.user.v2+json. For incompatible changes, a
new media type version for the resource is created. To generate the new
representation version, consumer and producer can do content negotiation
using the HTTP Content-Type and Accept headers. Note: This versioning
only applies to the request and response content schema, not to URI or
method semantics.

In this example, a client wants only the new version of the response:

[source,http]
----
Accept: application/vnd.uk.gov.hmcts.idam.user.v2+json
----

A server responding to this, as well as a client sending a request with
content should use the Content-Type header, declaring that one is
sending the new version:

[source,http]
----
Content-Type: application/vnd.uk.gov.hmcts.idam.user.v2+json
----

Using header versioning should:

* include versions in request and response headers to increase
visibility
* include Content-Type in the Vary header to enable proxy caches to
differ between versions

Hint: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/146[OpenAPI
currently doesn’t support content negotiation], though
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/146#issuecomment-117288707[a
comment in this issue] mentions a workaround (using a fragment
identifier that gets stripped off). Another way would be to document
just the new version, but let the server accept the old one (with the
previous content-type).

Until an incompatible change is necessary, it is recommended to stay
with the standard `application/json` media type.

[#115]
== {MUST} Do Not Use URI Versioning

With URI versioning a (major) version number is included in the path,
e.g. /v1/customers. The consumer has to wait until the provider has been
released and deployed. If the consumer also supports hypermedia links —
even in their APIs — to drive workflows (HATEOAS), this quickly becomes
complex. So does coordinating version upgrades — especially with
hyperlinked service dependencies — when using URL versioning. To avoid
this tighter coupling and complexer release management we do not use URI
versioning, and go instead with media type versioning and content
negotiation (see above).

[#116]
== {SHOULD} Provide Version Information in OpenAPI Documentation

Only the documentation, not the API itself, needs version information.

Example:

[source,json]
----
"swagger": "2.0",
"info": {
  "title": "Parcel service API",
  "description": "API for <...>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
    <...>
}
----

During a (possibly) long-running API review phase you need different
versions of the API description. These versions may include changes that
are incompatible with earlier draft versions. So we apply the following
version schema MAJOR.MINOR.DRAFT that increments the...

* MAJOR version, when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version, when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
manner
* DRAFT version, when you make changes during the review phase that are
not related to production releases

We recommend using the DRAFT version only for unreleased API definitions
that are still under review; for example:

....
version 1.4.0  -- current version
version 1.4.1  -- first draft and call for review of API extensions compatible with 1.4.0
version 1.4.2  -- second draft and call for review of API extensions that are still compatible with 1.4.0 but possibly incompatible with 1.4.1
version 1.5.0  -- approved version for implementation and release
version 1.5.1  -- first draft for next review and API change cycle; compatible with 1.4.0 and 1.5.0
....

Hint: This versioning scheme differs in the less strict DRAFT aspect
from http://semver.org[semantic version information] used for released
APIs and service applications.
