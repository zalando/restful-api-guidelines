= Introduction

Zalando’s software architecture centers around decoupled microservices
that provide functionality via RESTful APIs with a JSON payload. Small
engineering teams own, deploy and operate these microservices in their
AWS (team) accounts. Our APIs express most purely what our systems do,
and are therefore highly valuable business assets. Designing
high-quality, long-lasting APIs has become even more critical for us
since we started developing our new open platform strategy, which
transforms Zalando from an online shop into an expansive fashion
platform. Our strategy emphasizes developing lots of public APIs for our
external business partners to use via third-party applications.

With this in mind, we’ve adopted "API First" as one of our key
engineering principles. Microservices development begins with API
definition outside the code and ideally involves ample peer-review
feedback to achieve high-quality APIs. API First encompasses a set of
quality-related standards and fosters a peer review culture including a
lightweight review procedure. We encourage our teams to follow them to
ensure that our APIs:

* are easy to understand and learn
* are general and abstracted from specific implementation and use cases
* are robust and easy to use
* have a common look and feel
* follow a consistent RESTful style and syntax
* are consistent with other teams’ APIs and our global architecture

Ideally, all Zalando APIs will look like the same author created them.

The purpose of our "RESTful API guidelines" is to define standards to
successfully establish "consistent API look and feel" quality. The
{api-guild}[API Guild (internal_link)] 
drafted and owns this document. Teams are responsible to fulfill
these guidelines during API development and are encouraged to contribute
to guideline evolution via pull requests.

These guidelines will, to some extent, remain work in progress as our
work evolves, but teams can confidently follow and trust them.

In case guidelines are changing, following rules apply:

* existing APIs don't have to be changed, but we recommend it
* clients of existing APIs have to cope with these APIs based on
outdated rules
* new APIs have to respect the current guidelines

Furthermore you should keep in mind that once an API becomes public
externally available, it has to be re-reviewed and changed according to
current guidelines - for sake of overall consistency.
