= Introduction

Hypatos’s software architecture centers around decoupled microservices
that provide functionality via RESTful APIs with a JSON payload. Small
engineering teams own, deploy and operate these microservices into our
Kubernetes cluster. These APIs are exposed for internal and external use. 
However, our strategy emphasizes developing lots of public APIs for our
external business partners to use via third-party applications. In order to maximize the 
adoption of our public API, we pay a high attention to developer experience (DX) while 
designing the APIs.

With this in mind, we’ve adopted "API First" as one of our key
engineering principles. Microservices development begins with API
definition outside the code and ideally involves ample peer-review
feedback to achieve high-quality APIs. API First encompasses a set of
quality-related standards and fosters a peer review culture including a
lightweight review procedure. We encourage our teams to follow them to
ensure that our APIs:

* are easy to understand and learn
* are general and abstracted from specific implementation and use cases
* are robust and easy to use
* have a common look and feel
* follow a consistent RESTful style and syntax
* are consistent with other teams’ APIs and our global architecture

Ideally, all Hypatos APIs will look like the same author created them.

== API audience

As mentioned above our APIs are exposed for internal and external clients. Internal clients 
of a microservice are other microservices, internal utility tools or automation processes. 
Even though these clients are internal, they must respect the data ownership principle and 
retrieve the data using official APIs. Retrieving data from the databases from our services 
is forbidden.

While the APIs of individual microservices are available to our internal clients, they are 
not exposed to the internet. These APIs are exposed to the clients via an 
https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html[API gateway] which 
acts as a single entry point.

The API gateway insulates clients from internal details about how Hypatos 
architecture is partitioned into microservices by exposing a single "monolytic" Hypatos 
REST API. Our microservices may decide which of their endpoints are exposed for public 
access which are kept internal. This REST API can be accessed under the following base URL.

Any API exposed to the internet must be exposed via this base URL.

== Hypatos specific information

The purpose of our "RESTful API guidelines" is to define standards to
successfully establish "consistent API look and feel" quality. This document was 
drafted by https://github.com/zalando/restful-api-guidelines[Zalando] and adopted by the 
Hypatos API Governance guild. Our teams are responsible to fulfill
these guidelines during API development and are encouraged to contribute
to guideline evolution via pull requests.

These guidelines will, to some extent, remain work in progress as our
work evolves, but teams can confidently follow and trust them.

In case guidelines are changing, following rules apply:

* existing APIs don't have to be changed, but we recommend it
* clients of existing APIs have to cope with these APIs based on
outdated rules
* new APIs have to respect the current guidelines

Furthermore you should keep in mind that once an API becomes public
externally available, it has to be re-reviewed and changed according to
current guidelines - for sake of overall consistency.
