This change log only contains major changes made after November 2021.

Non-major changes are editorial-only changes or minor changes of existing guidelines, e.g. adding new error code.
Major changes are changes that come with additional obligations, or even change an existing guideline obligation.
The latter changes are additionally labeled with "Rule Change" here.

To see a list of all changes, please have a look at the https://github.com/dailypay/restful-api-guidelines/commits/master[commit list in Github].

(Note that recent changes might be missing, as we update this list only occasionally,
 not with each pull request, to avoid merge commits.)
