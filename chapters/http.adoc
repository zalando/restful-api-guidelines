[#148]
== {MUST} Use HTTP Methods Correctly

Be compliant with the standardized HTTP method semantics summarized as
follows:

[[get]]
=== GET

GET requests are used to read a single resource or query set of
resources.

* GET requests for individual resources will usually generate a 404 if
the resource does not exist
* GET requests for collection resources may return either 200 (if the
listing is empty) or 404 (if the list is missing)
* GET requests must NOT have request body payload

*Note:* GET requests on collection resources should provide a sufficient
filter mechanism as well as <<pagination>>.

[[get-with-body]]
=== "GET with Body"

APIs sometimes face the problem, that they have to provide extensive
structured request information with GET, that may even conflicts with
the size limits of clients, load-balancers, and servers. As we require
APIs to be standard conform (body in GET must be ignored on server
side), API designers have to check the following two options:

1.  GET with URL encoded query parameters: when it is possible to encode
the request information in query parameters, respecting the usual size
limits of clients, gateways, and servers, this should be the first
choice. The request information can either be provided distributed to
multiple query parameters or a single structured URL encoded string.
2.  POST with body content: when a GET with URL encoded query parameters
is not possible, a POST with body content must be used. In this case the
endpoint must be documented with the hint `GET with    body` to
transport the GET semantic of this call.

*Note:* It is no option to encode the lengthy structured request
information in header parameters. From a conceptual point of view, the
semantic of an operation should always be expressed by resource name and
query parameters, i.e. what goes into the URL. Request headers are
reserved for general context information, e.g. FlowIDs. In addition,
size limits on query parameters and headers are not reliable and depend
on clients, gateways, server, and actual settings. Thus, switching to
headers does not solve the original problem.

[[put]]
=== PUT

PUT requests are used to create or update *entire* resources - single or
collection resources. The semantic is best described as »_please put the
enclosed representation at the resource mentioned by the URL, replacing
any existing resource._«.

* PUT requests are usually applied to single resources, and not to
collection resources, as this would imply replacing the entire
collection
* PUT requests are usually robust against non-existence of resources by
implicitly creating before updating
* on successful PUT requests, the server will *replace the entire
resource* addressed by the URL with the representation passed in the
payload (subsequent reads will deliver the same payload)
* successful PUT requests will usually generate 200 or 204 (if the
resource was updated - with or without actual content returned), and 201
(if the resource was created)

*Note:* Resource IDs with respect to PUT requests are maintained by the
client and passed as a URL path segment. Putting the same resource twice
is required to be idempotent and to result in the same single resource
instance. If PUT is applied for creating a resource, only URIs should be
allowed as resource IDs. If URIs are not available POST should be
preferred.

To prevent unnoticed concurrent updates when using PUT, the combination
of <<182,`ETag` and `If-(None-)Match`>> headers should be considered to signal the server
stricter demands to expose conflicts and prevent lost updates. The section <<optimistic-locking>> also describes some 
alternatives to this approach. 

[[post]]
=== POST

POST requests are idiomatically used to create single resources on a
collection resource endpoint, but other semantics on single resources
endpoint are equally possible. The semantic for collection endpoints is
best described as »_please add the enclosed representation to the
collection resource identified by the URL_«. The semantic for single
resource endpoints is best described as »_please execute the given well
specified request on the collection resource identified by the URL_«.

* POST request should only be applied to collection resources, and
normally not on single resource, as this has an undefined semantic
* on successful POST requests, the server will create one or multiple
new resources and provide their URI/URLs in the response
* successful POST requests will usually generate 200 (if resources have
been updated), 201 (if resources have been created), and 202 (if the
request was accepted but has not been finished yet)

*More generally:* POST should be used for scenarios that cannot be
covered by the other methods sufficiently. For instance, GET with
complex (e.g. SQL like structured) query that needs to be passed as
request body payload because of the URL-length constraint. In such
cases, make sure to document the fact that POST is used as a workaround.

*Note:* Resource IDs with respect to POST requests are created and
maintained by server and returned with response payload. Posting the
same resource twice is by itself *not* required to be idempotent and may
result in multiple resource instances. Anyhow, if external URIs are
present that can be used to identify duplicate requests, it is best
practice to implement POST in an idempotent way.

[[patch]]
=== PATCH

PATCH request are only used for partial update of single resources, i.e.
where only a specific subset of resource fields should be replaced. The
semantic is best described as »_please change the resource identified by
the URL according to my change request_«. The semantic of the change
request is not defined in the HTTP standard and must be described in the
API specification by using suitable media types.

* PATCH requests are usually applied to single resources, and not on
collection resources, as this would imply patching on the entire
collection
* PATCH requests are usually not robust against non-existence of
resource instances
* on successful PATCH requests, the server will update parts of the
resource addressed by the URL as defined by the change request in the
payload
* successful PATCH requests will usually generate 200 or 204 (if
resources have been updated
* with or without updated content returned)

*Note:* since implementing PATCH correctly is a bit tricky, we strongly
suggest to choose one and only one of the following patterns per
endpoint, unless forced by a <<106,backwards compatible change>>.
In preference order:

1.  use PUT with complete objects to update a resource as long as
feasible (i.e. do not use PATCH at all).
2.  use PATCH with partial objects to only update parts of a resource,
whenever possible. (This is basically
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396[JSON Merge Patch], a specialized
media type `application/merge-patch+json` that is a partial resource
representation.)
3.  use PATCH with http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON Patch], a
specialized media type `application/json-patch+json` that includes
instructions on how to change the resource.
4.  use POST (with a proper description of what is happening) instead of
PATCH if the request does not modify the resource in a way defined by
the semantics of the media type.

In practice https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396[JSON Merge Patch]
quickly turns out to be too limited, especially when trying to update
single objects in large collections (as part of the resource). In this
cases http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON Patch] can shown its full
power while still showing readable patch requests
(see also http://erosb.github.io/post/json-patch-vs-merge-patch[JSON patch vs. merge]).

To prevent unnoticed concurrent updates when using PATCH, the
combination of <<182,`ETag`and `If-Match`>> headers should be considered to
signal the server stricter demands to expose conflicts and prevent lost updates.

[#delete]
=== DELETE

DELETE request are used to delete resources. The semantic is best
described as »_please delete the resource identified by the URL_«.

* DELETE requests are usually applied to single resources, not on
collection resources, as this would imply deleting the entire collection
* successful DELETE request will usually generate 200 (if the deleted
resource is returned) or 204 (if no content is returned)
* failed DELETE request will usually generate 404 (if the resource
cannot be found) or 410 (if the resource was already deleted before)

[[head]]
=== HEAD

HEAD requests are used to retrieve the header information of single
resources and resource collections.

* HEAD has exactly the same semantics as GET, but returns headers only,
no body.

[[options]]
=== OPTIONS

OPTIONS are used to inspect the available operations (HTTP methods) of a
given endpoint.

* OPTIONS requests usually either return a comma separated list of
methods (provided by an `Allow:`-Header) or as a structured list of link
templates

*Note:* OPTIONS is rarely implemented, though it could be used to
self-describe the full functionality of a resource.

[#149]
== {MUST} Fulfill Safeness and Idempotency Properties

An operation can be...

* idempotent, i.e. operation will have the same effect on the server's state if executed
once or multiple times (note: this does not necessarily mean returning
the same response or status code)
* safe, i.e. must not have side effects such as state changes

Method implementations must fulfill the following basic properties:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=============================
|HTTP method |safe |idempotent
|OPTIONS |Yes |Yes
|HEAD |Yes |Yes
|GET |Yes |Yes
|PUT |No |Yes
|POST |No |No
|DELETE |No |Yes
|PATCH |No |No
|=============================

Please see also https://goo.gl/vhwh8a[Best Practices [internal link]]
for further hints on how to support the different HTTP methods on
resources.

[#220]
== {MUST} Use Standard HTTP Status Codes

You must only use standardized HTTP status codes and consistently with 
their intended semantics. You must not invent new HTTP status codes.

RFC standards define ~60 different HTTP status codes with specific semantics 
(mainly https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6[RFC7231] and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585[RFC-6585]) — and there are upcoming
new ones, e.g.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-05[draft
legally-restricted-status]. See overview on all error codes on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes[Wikipedia] or
via https://httpstatuses.com/) also inculding 'unofficial codes', e.g. used
by popular web servers like Nginx.


[#150]
== {MUST} Use Most Specific HTTP Status Codes

You must use the most specific HTTP status code when returning information 
about your request processing status or error situations.

Below we listed the most commonly used and best understood HTTP status codes (consistent with RFC standard). 

You may use HTTP status codes not listed here, but in this case you must provide 
clear documentation in the API definition. As long as there is no need to use codes not listed here, you 
should not document the HTTP status codes to avoid risk of inconsistent definitions and 
reduced readability due to overload with common sense information.

|=======================================================================

[#151]
== {MUST} Specify Success and Error Responses

APIs should define the functional, business view and abstract from
implementation aspects. Success and error responses are a vital part to
define how an API is used correctly.

Therefore, the OpenAPI specification must contain definitions for **all**
success and error responses. Both are part of the interface definition and
provide important information for service clients to handle standard as well
as exceptional situations. For each response the most specific HTTP status
code should be selected that conveys the domain-specific success or error
semantic — see <<150>>.

To transport error information beside the status code, we use a standardized
error return object specification that must be used — see <<176>>.

**Remark:** In most cases it is not useful to document all technical errors,
especially if they are not under control of the service provider. Thus unless
a response code conveys application-specific functional semantics or is used
in a none standard way that requires additional explanation, multiple error
response specifications can be combined using the following pattern:

[source,yaml]
----
  default:
    description: a specific error occurred - see status code for more information.
    schema:
      $ref: 'https://zalando.github.io/problem/schema.yaml#/Problem'
----

**Note:** It is best practice to explicitly specify all successful status codes.
This prevents any conflict with the above pattern.

API designers should also think about a troubleshooting board as part of the
associated online API documentation. It provides information and handling
guidance on application-specific errors and is referenced via links from the
API specification. This can reduce service support tasks and contribute to
service client and provider performance.


[#152]
== {MUST} Use 207 for Batch or Bulk Requests

Some APIs are required to provide either _batch_ or _bulk_ requests
using POST for performance reasons, i.e. for communication and
processing efficiency. In this case services may be in need to signal
multiple response codes for each part of an batch or bulk request. As
HTTP does not provide proper guidance for handling batch/bulk requests
and responses, we herewith define the following approach:

* A batch or bulk request *always* has to respond with HTTP status code
*207*, unless it encounters a generic or unexpected failure before
looking at individual parts.
* A batch or bulk response with status code 207 *always* returns a
multi-status object containing sufficient status and/or monitoring
information for each part of the batch or bulk request.
* A batch or bulk request may result in a status code 400/500, only if
the service encounters a failure before looking at individual parts or,
if an unanticipated failure occurs.

The before rules apply _even in the case_ that processing of all
individual part _fail_ or each part is executed _asynchronously_! They
are intended to allow clients to act on batch and bulk responses by
inspecting the individual results in a consistent way.

*Note*: while a _batch_ defines a collection of requests triggering
independent processes, a _bulk_ defines a collection of independent
resources created or updated together in one request. With respect to
response processing this distinction normally does not matter.

[#153]
== {MUST} Use 429 with Headers for Rate Limits

APIs that wish to manage the request rate of clients must use the
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585['429 Too Many Requests'] response
code if the client exceeded the request rate and therefore the request
can't be fulfilled. Such responses must also contain header information
providing further details to the client. There are two approaches a
service can take for header information:

* Return a
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3['Retry-After'] header
indicating how long the client ought to wait before making a follow-up
request. The Retry-After header can contain a HTTP date value to retry
after or the number of seconds to delay. Either is acceptable but APIs
should prefer to use a delay in seconds.
* Return a trio of 'X-RateLimit' headers. These headers (described
below) allow a server to express a service level in the form of a number
of allowing requests within a given window of time and when the window
is reset.

The 'X-RateLimit' headers are:

* `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests that the client is
allowed to make in this window.
* `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests allowed in the current
window.
* `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The relative time in seconds when the rate limit
window will be reset.

The reason to allow both approaches is that APIs can have different
needs. Retry-After is often sufficient for general load handling and
request throttling scenarios and notably, does not strictly require the
concept of a calling entity such as a tenant or named account. In turn
this allows resource owners to minimise the amount of state they have to
carry with respect to client requests. The 'X-RateLimit' headers are
suitable for scenarios where clients are associated with pre-existing
account or tenancy structures. 'X-RateLimit' headers are generally
returned on every request and not just on a 429, which implies the
service implementing the API is carrying sufficient state to track the
number of requests made within a given window for each named entity.

[#154]
== {SHOULD} Explicitly define the Collection Format of Query Parameters

There are different ways of supplying a set of values as a query
parameter. One particular type should be selected and stated explicitly
in the API definition. The OpenAPI property
http://swagger.io/specification/[`collectionFormat`] is used to
specify the format of the query parameter.

Only the `csv` or `multi` formats should be used for multi-value query
parameters as described below.

[,cols="15%,25%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Collection Format |Description |Example
|`csv` |Comma separated values |`?parameter=value1,value2,value3`

|`multi` |Multiple parameter instances
|`?parameter=value1&parameter=value2&parameter=value3`
|=======================================================================

When choosing the collection format, take into account the tool support,
the escaping of special characters and the maximal URL length.
