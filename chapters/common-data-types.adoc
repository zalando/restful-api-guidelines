[#173]
== {MUST} Use a Common Money Object

Use the following common money structure:

[source,yaml]
----
include::../money.yaml[]
----

APIs are encouraged to include a reference to the global schema for Money.

[source,yaml]
----
SalesOrder:
  properties:
    grand_total:
      $ref: 'https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/money-1.0.0.yaml#/Money'
----

Please note that APIs have to treat Money as a closed data type, i.e. it's not meant to be used in an inheritance hierarchy. That means the following usage is not allowed:

[source,json]
----
{
  "amount": 19.99,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "discounted_amount": 9.99
}
----

=== Cons

* Violates the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle[Liskov Substitution Principle]
* Breaks existing library support, e.g. https://github.com/zalando/jackson-datatype-money[Jackson Datatype Money]
* Less flexible since both amounts are coupled together, e.g. mixed currencies are impossible

A better approach is to favor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance[composition over inheritance]:

[source,json]
----
{
    "price": {
      "amount": 19.99,
      "currency": "EUR"
    },
    "discounted_price": {
      "amount": 9.99,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }
}
----

=== Pros

* No inheritance, hence no issue with the substitution principle
* Makes use of existing library support
* No coupling, i.e. mixed currencies is an option
* Prices are now self-describing, atomic values

=== Notes

Please be aware that some business cases (e.g. transactions in Bitcoin) call for a higher precision, so applications must be prepared to accept values with unlimited precision, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the API specification.

Examples for correct representations (in EUR):

* `42.20` or `42.2` = 42 Euros, 20 Cent
* `0.23` = 23 Cent
* `42.0` or `42` = 42 Euros
* `1024.42` = 1024 Euros, 42 Cent
* `1024.4225` = 1024 Euros, 42.25 Cent

Make sure that you don’t convert the "amount" field to `float` /
`double` types when implementing this interface in a specific language
or when doing calculations. Otherwise, you might lose precision.
Instead, use exact formats like Java’s
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html[`BigDecimal`].
See http://stackoverflow.com/a/3730040/342852[Stack Overflow] for more
info.

Some JSON parsers (NodeJS’s, for example) convert numbers to floats by
default. After discussing the pros and cons we’ve decided on "decimal" as our amount format. It
is not a standard OpenAPI format, but should help us to avoid parsing numbers
as float / doubles.

[#174]
== {MUST} Use common field names and semantics

There exist a variety of field types that are required in multiple
places. To achieve consistency across all API implementations, you must
use common field names and semantics whenever applicable.

[[generic-fields]]
=== Generic Fields

There are some data fields that come up again and again in API data:

* [[id]]{id}: the identity of the object. If used, IDs must be opaque strings
  and not numbers. IDs are unique within some documented context, are stable
  and don't change for a given object once assigned, and are never recycled
  cross entities.
* [[xyz_id]]{xyz_id}: an attribute within one object holding the identifier of
  another object must use a name that corresponds to the type of the referenced
  object or the relationship to the referenced object followed by `_id` (e.g.
  `customer_id` not `customer_number`; `parent_node_id` for the reference to a parent
  node from a child node, even if both have the type `Node`)
* [[created_at]]{created_at}: when the object was created. If used, this must
  be a `date-time` construct. Originally named [[created]]{created} before
  adding the <<235, naming conventions for date/time properties>>.
* [[modified_at]]{modified_at}: when the object was updated. If used, this must
  be a `date-time` construct. Originally named [[modified]]{modified} before
  adding the <<235, naming conventions for date/time properties>>.
* [[type]]{type}: the kind of thing this object is. If used, the type of this
  field should be a string. Types allow runtime information on the entity
  provided that otherwise requires examining the Open API file.
* [[etag]]{etag}: the <<182, ETag>> of an <<158, embedded sub-resource>>. It
  may be used to carry the {ETag} for subsequent {PUT}/{PATCH} calls (see
  <<etag-in-result-entities>>).

Example JSON schema:

[source,yaml]
----
tree_node:
  type: object
  properties: 
    id:
      description: the identifier of this node
      type: string
    created_at:
      description: when got this node created
      type: string
      format: 'date-time'
    modified_at:
      description: when got this node last updated
      type: string
      format: 'date-time'
    type:
      type: string
      enum: [ 'LEAF', 'NODE' ]
    parent_node_id:
      description: the identifier of the parent node of this node
      type: string
  example:
    id: '123435'
    created: '2017-04-12T23:20:50.52Z'
    modified: '2017-04-12T23:20:50.52Z'
    type: 'LEAF'
    parent_node_id: '534321'
----

These properties are not always strictly necessary, but making them idiomatic
allows API client developers to build up a common understanding of Zalando's
resources. There is very little utility for API consumers in having different
names or value types for these fields across APIs.

[[link-relation-fields]]
=== Link Relation Fields

To foster a consistent look and feel using simple hypertext controls for
paginating and iterating over collection values the response objects should
follow a common pattern using the below field semantics:

* [[self]]{self}:the link or cursor in a pagination response or object
  pointing to the same collection object or page.
* [[first]]{first}: the link or cursor in a pagination response or object
  pointing to the first collection object or page.
* [[prev]]{prev}: the link or cursor in a pagination response or object
  pointing to the previous collection object or page.
* [[next]]{next}: the link or cursor in a pagination response or object
  pointing to the next collection object or page.
* [[last]]{last}: the link or cursor in a pagination response or object
  pointing to the last collection object or page.

Pagination responses should contain the following additional array field to
transport the page content:

* [[items]]{items}: array of resources, holding all the items of the current
  page ({items} may be replaced by a resource name).

To simplify user experience, the applied query filters may be returned using
the following field (see also {GET-with-body}):

* [[query]]{query}: object containing the query filters applied in the search
  request to filter the collection resource.

As Result, the standard response page using <<161, pagination links>> is
defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
ResponsePage:
  type: object
  properties: 
    self:
      description: Pagination link pointing to the current page.
      type: string
      format: uri
    first:
      description: Pagination link pointing to the first page.
      type: string
      format: uri
    prev:
      description: Pagination link pointing to the previous page.
      type: string
      format: uri
    next:
      description: Pagination link pointing to the next page.
      type: string
      format: uri
    last:
      description: Pagination link pointing to the last page.
      type: string
      format: uri

     query:
       description: >
         Object containing the query filters applied to the collection resource.
       type: object
       properties: ...

     items:
       description: Array of collection items.
       type: array
       required: false
       items:
         type: ...
----

The response page may contain additional metadata about the collection or the
current page.


[[address-fields]]
=== Address Fields

Address structures play a role in different functional and use-case
contexts, including country variances. All attributes that relate to
address information should follow the naming and semantics defined
below.

[source,yaml]
----
addressee:
  description: a (natural or legal) person that gets addressed
  type: object
  properties:
    salutation:
      description: |
        a salutation and/or title used for personal contacts to some
        addressee; not to be confused with the gender information!
      type: string
      example: Mr
    first_name:
      description: |
        given name(s) or first name(s) of a person; may also include the
        middle names.
      type: string
      example: Hans Dieter
    last_name:
      description: |
        family name(s) or surname(s) of a person
      type: string
      example: Mustermann
    business_name:
      description: |
        company name of the business organization. Used when a business is
        the actual addressee; for personal shipments to office addresses, use
        `care_of` instead.
      type: string
      example: Consulting Services GmbH
  required:
    - first_name
    - last_name

address:
  description:
    an address of a location/destination
  type: object
  properties:
    care_of:
      description: |
        (aka c/o) the person that resides at the address, if different from
        addressee. E.g. used when sending a personal parcel to the
        office /someone else's home where the addressee resides temporarily
      type: string
      example: Consulting Services GmbH
    street:
      description: |
        the full street address including house number and street name
      type: string
      example: Schönhauser Allee 103
    additional:
      description: |
        further details like building name, suite, apartment number, etc.
      type: string
      example: 2. Hinterhof rechts
    city:
      description: |
        name of the city / locality
      type: string
      example: Berlin
    zip:
      description: |
        zip code or postal code
      type: string
      example: 14265
    country_code:
      description: |
        the country code according to
        [iso-3166-1-alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
      type: string
      example: DE
  required:
    - street
    - city
    - zip
    - country_code
----

Grouping and cardinality of fields in specific data types may vary based
on the specific use case (e.g. combining addressee and address fields
into a single type when modeling an address label vs distinct addressee
and address types when modeling users and their addresses).
