The best practices presented in this section are not part of the actual
guidelines, but should provide guidance for common challenges we face when
implementing RESTful APIs.


[[cursor-based-pagination]]
== Cursor-based pagination in RESTful APIs

Cursor-based pagination is a very powerful and valuable technique (see also
<<160>>) that allows to efficiently provide a stable view on changing data.
This is obtained by using an anchor element that allows to retrieve all page
elements directly via an ordering combined-index, usually based on `created_at`
or `modified_at`. Simple said, the cursor is the information set needed to
reconstruct the database query that retrieves the minimal page information from
the data storage.

The {cursor} itself is an opaque string, transmitted forth and back between
service and clients, that must never be *inspected* or *constructed* by
clients. Therefore, it is good practice to encode (encrypt) its content in a
non-human-readable form.

The {cursor} content usually consists of a pointer to the anchor element
defining the page position in the collection, a flag whether the element is
included or excluded into/from the page, the retrieval direction, and a hash
over the applied query filters (or the query filter itself) to safely re-create
the collection. It is important to note, that a {cursor} should be always
defined in relation to the current page to anticipate all occurring changes
when progressing.

The {cursor} is usually defined as an encoding of the following information:

[source,yaml]
----
Cursor:
  descriptions: >
    Cursor structure that contains all necessary information to efficiently
    retrieve a page from the data store.
  type: object
  properties:
    position:
      description: >
        Object containing the keys pointing to the anchor element that is
        defining the collection resource page. Normally the position is given
        by the first or the last page element. The position object contains all
        values required to access the element efficiently via the ordered,
        combined index, e.g `modified_at`, `id`.
      type: object
      properties: ...

    element:
      description: >
        Flag whether the anchor element, which is pointed to by the `position`,
        should be *included* or *excluded* from the result set. Normally, only
        the current page includes the pointed to element, while all others are
        exclude it.
      type: string
      enum: [ INCLUDED, EXCLUDED ]

    direction:
      description: >
        Flag for the retrieval direction that is defining which elements to
        choose from the collection resource starting from the anchor elements
        position. It is either *ascending* or *descending* based on the
        ordering combined index.
      type: string
      enum: [ ASCENDING, DESCENDING ]

    query_hash:
      description: >
        Stable hash calculated over all query filters applied to create the
        collection resource that is represented by this cursor.
      type: string

    query:
      description: >
        Object containing all query filters applied to create the collection
        resource that is represented by this cursor.
      type: object
      properties: ...

  required:
    - position
    - element
    - direction
----

*Note:* In case of complex and long search requests, e.g. when {GET-with-body}
is already required, the {cursor} may not be able to include the `query` because
of common HTTP parameter size restrictions. In this case the `query` filters
should be transported via body - in the request as well as in the response,
while the pagination consistency should be ensured via the `query_hash`.

*Remark:* It is also important to check the efficiency of the data-access.
You need to make sure that you have a fully ordered stable index, that allows
to efficiently resolve all elements of a page. If necessary, you need to
provide a combined index that includes the `id` to ensure the full order and
additional filter criteria to ensure efficiency.

[[optimistic-locking]]
== Optimistic locking in RESTful APIs

=== Introduction
Optimistic locking might be used to avoid concurrent writes on the same entity,
which might cause data loss. A client always has to retrieve a copy of an
entity first and specifically update this one. If another version has been
created in the meantime, the update should fail. In order to make this work,
the client has to provide some kind of version reference, which is checked by
the service, before the update is executed. Please read the more detailed
description on how to update resources via {PUT} in the <<put, HTTP Requests
Section>>.

A RESTful API usually includes some kind of search endpoint, which will then
return a list of result entities. There are several ways to implement
optimistic locking in combination with search endpoints which, depending on the
approach chosen, might lead to performing additional requests to get the
current version of the entity that should be updated.

=== `ETag` with `If-Match` header
An {ETag} can only be obtained by performing a {GET} request on the single
entity resource before the update, i.e. when using a search endpoint an
additional request is necessary.

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042" },
>     { "id": "O0000043" }
>   ]
> }

< GET /orders/BO0000042

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> ETag: osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf
> { "id": "BO0000042", ... }

< PUT /orders/O0000042
< If-Match: osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf
< { "id": "O0000042", ... }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

Or, if there was an update since the {GET} and the entity's {ETag} has changed:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition failed
----

==== Pros
* RESTful solution

==== Cons
* Many additional requests are necessary to build a meaningful front-end

[[etag-in-result-entities]]
=== `ETags` in result entities
The ETag for every entity is returned as an additional property of that entity.
In a response containing multiple entities, every entity will then have a
distinct {ETag} that can be used in subsequent {PUT} requests.

In this solution, the {e_tag} property should be `readonly` and never be expected
in the {PUT} request payload.

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042", "etag": "osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf", "foo": 42, "bar": true },
>     { "id": "O0000043", "etag": "kjshdfknjqlowjdsljdnfkjbkn", "foo": 24, "bar": false }
>   ]
> }

< PUT /orders/O0000042
< If-Match: osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf
< { "id": "O0000042", "foo": 43, "bar": true }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

Or, if there was an update since the {GET} and the entity's {ETag} has changed:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition failed
----

==== Pros
* Perfect optimistic locking

==== Cons
* Information that only belongs in the HTTP header is part of the business
  objects

=== Version numbers
The entities contain a property with a version number. When an update is
performed, this version number is given back to the service as part of the
payload. The service performs a check on that version number to make sure it
was not incremented since the consumer got the resource and performs the
update, incrementing the version number.

Since this operation implies a modification of the resource by the service, a
{POST} operation on the exact resource (e.g. `POST /orders/O0000042`) should be
used instead of a {PUT}.

In this solution, the `version` property is not `readonly` since it is provided
at {POST} time as part of the payload.

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042", "version": 1,  "foo": 42, "bar": true },
>     { "id": "O0000043", "version": 42, "foo": 24, "bar": false }
>   ]
> }

< POST /orders/O0000042
< { "id": "O0000042", "version": 1, "foo": 43, "bar": true }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

or if there was an update since the {GET} and the version number in the
database is higher than the one given in the request body:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
----

==== Pros
* Perfect optimistic locking

==== Cons
* Functionality that belongs into the HTTP header becomes part of the
  business object
* Using {POST} instead of PUT for an update logic (not a problem in itself,
  but may feel unusual for the consumer)

=== `Last-Modified` / `If-Unmodified-Since`
In HTTP 1.0 there was no {ETag} and the mechanism used for optimistic locking
was based on a date. This is still part of the HTTP protocol and can be used.
Every response contains a {Last-Modified} header with a HTTP date. When
requesting an update using a {PUT} request, the client has to provide this
value via the header {If-Unmodified-Since}. The server rejects the request, if
the last modified date of the entity is after the given date in the header.

This effectively catches any situations where a change that happened between
{GET} and {PUT} would be overwritten. In the case of multiple result entities,
the {Last-Modified} header will be set to the latest date of all the entities.
This ensures that any change to any of the entities that happens between {GET}
and {PUT} will be detectable, without locking the rest of the batch as well.

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042", ... },
>     { "id": "O0000043", ... }
>   ]
> }

< PUT /block/O0000042
< If-Unmodified-Since: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
< { "id": "O0000042", ... }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

Or, if there was an update since the {GET} and the entities last modified is
later than the given date:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition failed
----

==== Pros
* Well established approach that has been working for a long time
* No interference with the business objects; the locking is done via HTTP
  headers only
* Very easy to implement
* No additional request needed when updating an entity of a search endpoint
  result

==== Cons
* If a client communicates with two different instances and their clocks are
  not perfectly in sync, the locking could potentially fail

=== Conclusion
We suggest to either use the _{ETag} in result entities_ or _{Last-Modified}
/ {If-Unmodified-Since}_ approach.


[[handling-compatible-extensions]]
== Handling compatible API extensions

[[client-handling-compatible-extensions]]
=== In the clients

Client must not eliminate unknown optional fields from the 
fetched resource payload, and to serialize them later when submitting the
complete resource payload back to the API server via {PUT} (<<108>>).

When using Java with Jackson serialization, for example, that can be achieved
by including a field in the Java class representing the API resource, like the
following one:

[source,java]
----
@JsonAnyGetter
@JsonAnySetter
private Map<String, JsonNode> additionalProperties = new HashMap<>();
----
