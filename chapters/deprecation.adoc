= Deprecation

Sometimes it is necessary to phase out an API endpoint (or version), for instance, 
if a field is no longer supported in the result or a whole business functionality 
behind an endpoint has to be shut down. There are many other reasons as well. 
As long as these endpoints are still used by consumers these are breaking 
changes and not allowed. Deprecation rules have to be applied to make sure that 
necessary consumer changes are aligned and deprecated endpoints are not used
before API changes are deployed. 

[#185]
== {MUST} Obtain Approval of Clients

Before shutting down an API (or version of an API) the producer must
make sure, that all clients have given their consent to shut down the
endpoint. Producers should help consumers to migrate to a potential new
endpoint (i.e. by providing a migration manual). After all clients are
migrated, the producer may shut down the deprecated API.

[#186]
== {MUST} External Partners Must Agree on Deprecation Timespan

If the API is consumed by any external partner, the producer must define
a reasonable timespan that the API will be maintained after the producer
has announced deprecation. The external partner (client) must agree to
this minimum after-deprecation-lifespan before he starts using the API.

[#187]
== {MUST} Reflect Deprecation in API Definition

API deprecation must be part of the OpenAPI definition. If a method on a
path, a whole path or even a whole API endpoint (multiple paths) should
be deprecated, the producers must set `deprecated=true` on each method /
path element that will be deprecated (OpenAPI 2.0 only allows you to
define deprecation on this level). If deprecation should happen on a
more fine grained level (i.e. query parameter, payload etc.), the
producer should set `deprecated=true` on the affected method / path
element and add further explanation to the `description` section.

If `deprecated` is set to `true`, the producer must describe what
clients should use instead and when the API will be shut down in the
`description` section of the API definition.

[#188]
== {MUST} Monitor Usage of Deprecated APIs

Owners of APIs used in production must monitor usage of deprecated APIs
until the API can be shut down in order to align deprecation and avoid
uncontrolled breaking effects. See also the <<193>>.

[#189]
== {SHOULD} Add a Warning Header to Responses

During deprecation phase, the producer should add a `Warning` header (see
{RFC-7234}#section-5.5[RFC 7234 - Warning header]) field. When adding the
`Warning` header, the `warn-code` must be `299` and the `warn-text` should be
in form of 

[source,txt]
----
The path/operation/parameter/... {name} is deprecated and will be removed by {date}.
Please see {link} for details.
----

with a link to a documentation describing why the API is no longer supported
in the current form and what clients should do about it. Adding the `Warning`
header is not sufficient to gain client consent to shut down an API.

[#190]
== {SHOULD} Add Monitoring for Warning Header

Clients should monitor the `Warning` header in HTTP responses to see if
an API will be deprecated in future.

[#191]
== {MUST} Don't Start Using Deprecated APIs

Clients must not start using deprecated parts of an API.
