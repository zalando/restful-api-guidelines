== {MUST} secure endpoints

Every API endpoint must be protected and armed with authentication and authorization.
As part of the API definition you must specify how you protect your API using
either the `http` typed `bearer` or `oauth2` typed security schemes defined in the
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/[OpenAPI Authentication Specification].

The majority of our APIs (especially the company internal APIs) are protected
using JWT tokens provided by the platform IAM token service. In these situations
you should use the `http` typed
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/[Bearer Authentication]
security scheme -- it is based on OAuth2.0 {RFC-6750}[RFC 6750] defining the standard header
`Auhorization: Bearer <token>`.
The following code snippet shows how to define the bearer security scheme.

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
----

The bearer security schema can then be applied to all API endpoints, e.g. requiring
the token to have `api-repository.read` scope for permission as follows (see
also <<105>>):

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  - BearerAuth: [ api-repository.read ]
----


In other, more specific situations e.g. with customer and partner facing APIs you
may use other OAuth 2.0 authorization flows as defined by {RFC-6749}[RFC 6749].
Please consult the
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/[OpenAPI OAuth 2.0 Authentication]
section for details on how to define `oauth2` typed security schemes correctly.

*Note:* Do not use OpenAPI `oauth2` typed security scheme flows (e.g. `implicit`)
if your service does not fully support it and implements a simple bearer token scheme,
because it exposes authentication server address details and may make use of redirection.


[#105]
== {MUST} define and assign permissions (scopes)

Endpoints must be equipped with permissions, if they require client authorization for protection 
since e.g. data is exposed that is classified as `orange` or `red` according to Zalando's 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UPB0UbZP7IvcB52DVWQX41pmB7ugJdAX/view[Data Classification Group Policy (internal link)]. 
Please refer to <<225>> for designing permission names. 
Some API endpoints may not require specific permissions for authorization e.g. 
in case of (i) authorization is _not_ needed for the endpoint since all
exposed data is classified as `green` or `yellow`, 
or in case of (ii) the specific authorization is provided differently on 
the individual object level. In these situations, however, you must make 
it explicit by assigning the `uid` pseudo permission, which is always 
available as OAuth2 default scope for all clients in Zalando. 

The defined permissions are assigned to each API endpoint based on the
security schema (see example in <<104, previous section>>) by specifying the
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#securityRequirementObject[security requirement]
as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
paths:
 /business-partners/{partner-id}:
    get:
      summary: Retrieves information about a business partner
      security:
        - BearerAuth: [ business-partner-service.read ]
----

*Hint:* Following a minimal API specification approach, the
`Authorization`-header does not need to be defined on each API endpoint, since
it is required and so to say implicitly defined via the security section.


[#225]
== {MUST} follow the naming convention for permissions (scopes)

As long as the <<223,functional naming>> is not yet supported by our permission registry,
permission names in APIs must conform to the following naming pattern:

[source,bnf]
-----
<permission> ::= <standard-permission> |  -- should be sufficient for majority of use cases
                 <resource-permission> |  -- for special security access differentiation use cases
                 <pseudo-permission>      -- used to explicitly indicate that access is not restricted

<standard-permission> ::= <application-id>.<access-mode>
<resource-permission> ::= <application-id>.<resource-name>.<access-mode>
<pseudo-permission>   ::= uid

<application-id>      ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- application identifier
<resource-name>       ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- free resource identifier
<access-mode>         ::= read | write    -- might be extended in future
-----

**Note:** This naming convention only applies to scopes for service-to-service
communication using the Platform IAM tokens. For IAM systems with other naming
rules (e.g. Zalando Partner IAM), the naming should be consistent with the
existing conventions of those systems.

////
//Prepared change for functional permission names:
Permission names in APIs must, respectively should conform to the functional
naming depending on the <<219, audience>> as follows (see <<223>> for details
and `<functional-name>` definition):

[source,bnf]
-----
<permission> ::= <functional-permission> |
                 <standard-permission> |  -- standard permission without functional naming
                 <resource-permission> |  -- resource permission without functional naming
                 <pseudo-permission>      -- used to indicate unrestricted access

<functional-permission> ::= z::<functional-name>[.<resource-name>].<access-mode>
<pseudo-permission>     ::= uid

<resource-name>       ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- free resource identifier
<access-mode>         ::= read || write    -- might be extended in future
-----

The following application specific legacy convention is *only* allowed for
permissions names of <<223, internal>> APIs:

[source,bnf]
-----
<standard-permission> ::= <application-id>.<access-mode>
<resource-permission> ::= <application-id>.<resource-name>.<access-mode>

<application-id>      ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- application identifier

-----

////

The permission naming schema corresponds to the naming schema for <<224,
hostnames>> and <<213, event type names>>, and typical examples are:

[cols="25%,20%,15%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Application ID | Resource ID | Access Type | Example
| `order-management` | `sales-order` | `read` | `order-management.sales-order.read`
| `order-management` | `shipment-order` | `read` | `order-management.shipment-order.read`
| `fulfillment-order` | | `write` | `fulfillment-order.write`
| `business-partner-service` | |`read` | `business-partner-service.read`
|=======================================================================

////
//Prepared change for functional permission names:

[cols="15%,15%,15%,15%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Domain | Component | Resource | Access Type | Example
| finance | exchange-rate | - | write | z::finance.exchange-rate.write
| transactions | order | - | read | z::transactions.order.read
| customer | address | shipment-address | read  | z::customer.address.shipment-address.read
|=======================================================================
[cols="30%,15%,15%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Application | Resource | Access Type | Example
| business-partner-service | | - | read | z::business-partner-service.read
| order-management | sales-order | write | z::order-management.sales-order.write
|=======================================================================

////

*Note:* APIs should stick to component specific permissions without resource
extension to avoid the complexity of too many fine grained permissions. For the
majority of use cases, restricting access for specific API endpoints using read
or write is sufficient.
