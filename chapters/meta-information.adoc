== {MUST} contain API meta information
API specifications must contain the following OpenAPI meta information
to allow for API management:

- `#/info/title` as (unique) identifying, functional descriptive name of the API
- `#/info/version` to distinguish API specifications versions following
  <<116, semantic rules>>
- `#/info/description` containing a proper description of the API
- `#/info/contact/{name,url,email}` containing the responsible team

Following OpenAPI extension properties *must* be provided in addition:

- `#/info/x-api-id` unique identifier of the API (<<215, see rule 215>>)
- `#/info/x-audience` intended target audience of the API (<<219, see rule 219>>)


[#116]
== {MUST} use semantic versioning

OpenAPI allows to specify the API specification version in
`#/info/version`. To share a common semantic of version information we
expect API designers to comply to http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[
Semantic Versioning 2.0] rules `1` to `8` and `11` restricted to the format
<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> for versions as follows:

* Increment the **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
after having aligned the changes with consumers,
* Increment the **MINOR** version when you add new functionality in a
backwards-compatible manner, and
* Optionally increment the **PATCH** version when you make
backwards-compatible bug fixes or editorial changes not affecting the
functionality.

*Additional Notes:*

* *Pre-release* versions (http://semver.org#spec-item-9[rule 9]) and
*build metadata* (http://semver.org#spec-item-10[rule 10]) must not
be used in API version information.
* While patch versions are useful for fixing typos etc, API designers
are free to decide whether they increment it or not.
* API designers should consider to use API version `0.y.z`
(http://semver.org/#spec-item-4[rule 4]) for initial API design.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Parcel Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.3.7
  <...>
----


[#215]
== {MUST} provide API identifiers

Each API specification must be provisioned with a globally unique and
immutable API identifier. The API identifier is defined in the `info`-block
of the OpenAPI specification and must conform to the following definition:

[source,yaml]
----
/info/x-api-id:
  type: string
  format: urn
  pattern: ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-:.]{6,62}[a-z0-9]$
  description: |
    Mandatory globally unique and immutable API identifier. The API
    id allows to track the evolution and history of an API specification
    as a sequence of versions.
----

API specifications will evolve and any aspect of an OpenAPI specification
may change. We require API identifiers because we want  to support API clients
and providers with API lifecycle management features, like change trackability
and history or automated backward compatibility checks. The immutable API
identifier allows the identification of all API specification versions of an
API evolution. By using  <<116, API semantic version information>> or <<192,
API publishing date>> as order criteria you get the *version* or
*publication history* as a sequence of API specifications.

*Note*: While it is nice to use human readable API identifiers based on
self-managed URNs, it is recommend to stick to UUIDs to relief API designers
from any urge of changing the API identifier while evolving the API. Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  x-api-id: d0184f38-b98d-11e7-9c56-68f728c1ba70
  title: Parcel Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.5.8
  <...>
----


[#219]
== {MUST} provide API audience

Each API must be classified with respect to the intended target *audience*
supposed to consume the API, to facilitate differentiated standards on APIs
for discoverability, changeability, quality of design and documentation, as
well as permission granting. We differentiate the following API audience
groups with clear organisational and legal boundaries:

*component-internal*::
  This is often referred to as a _team internal API_ or a _product internal API_.
  The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of the
  same *functional component* which typically represents a specific *product*
  with clear functional scope and ownership.
  All services of a functional component / product are owned by a specific dedicated owner
  and engineering team(s). Typical examples of component-internal APIs are APIs
  being used by internal helper and worker services or that support service operation.
*business-unit-internal*::
  The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of a
  specific product portfolio owned by the same business unit.
*company-internal*::
  The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications owned
  by the business units of the same the company (e.g. Zalando company with
  Zalando SE, Zalando Payments SE & Co. KG. etc.)
*external-partner*::
  The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications of
  business partners of the company owning the API and the company itself.
*external-public*::
  APIs with this audience can be accessed by anyone with Internet access.

*Note:* a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group
and thus does not need to be declared additionally.

The API audience is provided as API meta information in the `info`-block of
the OpenAPI specification and must conform to the following specification:

[source,yaml]
----
/info/x-audience:
  type: string
  x-extensible-enum:
    - component-internal
    - business-unit-internal
    - company-internal
    - external-partner
    - external-public
  description: |
    Intended target audience of the API. Relevant for standards around
    quality of design and documentation, reviews, discoverability,
    changeability, and permission granting.
----

*Note:* Exactly *one audience* per API specification is allowed. For this
reason a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group
and thus does not need to be declared additionally. If parts of your API have
a different target audience, we recommend to split API specifications along
the target audience — even if this creates redundancies
({api-audience-narrative}[rationale (internal_link)]).

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  x-audience: company-internal
  title: Parcel Helper Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.2.4
  <...>
----

For details and more information on audience groups see the
{api-audience-narrative}[API Audience narrative (internal_link)].


[#223]
== {MUST-SHOULD} use functional naming schema

Functional naming is a powerful, yet easy way to align global resources as
_host_, _permission_, and _event names_ within an application landscape. It
helps to preserve uniqueness of names while giving readers meaningful context
information about the addressed component. Besides, the most important aspect
is, that it allows to keep APIs stable in the case of technical and
organizational changes (Zalando for example maintains an internal naming convention).

A unique `functional-name` is assigned to each functional component serving an API.
It is built of the domain name of the functional group the component is belonging
to and a unique a short identifier for the functional component itself:

[source,bnf]
----
<functional-name>      ::= <functional-domain>-<functional-component>
<functional-domain>    ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]* -- managed functional group of components
<functional-component> ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]* -- name of API owning functional component
----

Depending on the <<219, API audience>>, you *must/should/may* follow the functional
naming schema for <<224, hostnames>> and <<213, event names>>
(and also <<225, permission names>>, in future) as follows:

[cols="25%,75%,options="header"]
|=========================================================
| *Functional Naming* | *Audience*
| *must*   | external-public, external-partner
| *should* | company-internal, business-unit-internal
| *may*    | component-internal
|=========================================================

Please see the following rules for detailed functional naming patterns:
* <<224>>
* <<213>>
// * <<225>>


*Internal Guideance*:  You _must_ use the simple
{functional-name-registry}[functional name registry (internal_link)] 
to register your functional name before using
it. The registry is a centralized infrastructure service to ensure uniqueness
of your functional names (and available domains -- including subdomains) and
to support hostname DNS resolution. +
_Hint:_ Due to lexicalic restrictions of DNS names there is no specific separator
to split a functional name into (sub) domain and component; this knowledge is only
managed in the registry.


[#224]
== {MUST} follow naming convention for hostnames

Hostnames in APIs must, respectively should conform to the functional naming
depending on the <<219, audience>> as follows (see <<223>> for details and
`<functional-name>` definition):

[source,bnf]
-----
<hostname>             ::= <functional-hostname> | <application-hostname>

<functional-hostname>  ::= <functional-name>.zalandoapis.com
-----

*Hint:* The following convention (e.g. used by legacy STUPS infrastructure) is deprecated
and *only* allowed for hostnames of <<219, component-internal>> APIs:

[source,bnf]
-----
<application-hostname> ::= <application-id>.<organization-unit>.zalan.do
<application-id>       ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- application identifier
<organization-id>      ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- organization unit identifier, e.g. team identifier
-----

*Exception:* There are legacy hostnames used for APIs with `external-partner` audience
which may not follow this rule due to backward compatibility constraints.
The API Linter maintains an allow-list for these exceptions (including e.g.
`api.merchants.zalando.com` and `api-sandbox.merchants.zalando.com`).
