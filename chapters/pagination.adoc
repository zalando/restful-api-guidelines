== {MUST} support pagination

Access to lists of data items must support pagination to protect the service
against overload as well as to support client side iteration and batch
processing experience. This holds true for all lists that are (potentially)
larger than just a few hundred entries.

There are two well known page iteration techniques:

* **Offset-based pagination**: numeric offset identifies the first page-entry
* **Cursor-based pagination** â€” aka key-based pagination: a unique key
  identifies the first page-entry (see also
  https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/cursoring[Twitter API] or
  https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results[Facebook API])

The technical conception of pagination should also consider user experience
(see {smashing-pagination}[Pagination Usability Findings In eCommerce]), for
instance, jumping to a specific page is far less used than navigation via
{next}/{prev} page links (see <<161>>). This favors an API design using
cursor-based instead of offset-based pagination -- see <<160>>.

**Note:** To provide a consistent look and feel of pagination patterns,
you must stick to the common query parameter names defined in <<137>>.

== {SHOULD} prefer cursor-based pagination, avoid offset-based pagination

Cursor-based pagination is usually better and more efficient when compared to
offset-based pagination. Especially when it comes to high-data volumes and/or
storage in NoSQL databases.

Before choosing cursor-based pagination, consider the following trade-offs:

* Usability/framework support:
  ** Offset-based pagination is more widely known than cursor-based pagination,
    so it has more framework support and is easier to use for API clients.
* Use case - jump to a certain page:
  ** If jumping to a particular page in a range (e.g., 51 of 100) is really a
   required use case, cursor-based navigation may not be feasible.
* Data changes may lead to anomalies in result pages:
  ** Offset-based pagination may create duplicates or lead to missing entries
     if rows are inserted or deleted between two subsequent paging requests.
  ** If implemented incorrectly, cursor-based pagination may fail when the
     cursor entry has been deleted before fetching the pages.
* Performance considerations - efficient server-side processing using
  offset-based pagination is hardly feasible for:
  ** Very big data sets, especially if they cannot reside in the main memory of
     the database.
  ** Sharded or NoSQL databases.

The {cursor} used for pagination is an opaque pointer to a page, that must
never be *inspected* or *constructed* by clients. It usually encodes (encrypts)
the page position, i.e. the unique identifier of the first or last page
element, the pagination direction, and the applied query filters (or a hash
over these) to safely recreate the collection (see also best practice
<<cursor-based-pagination>> below).


[#248]
== {SHOULD} use pagination response page object

[[pagination-fields]]
For iterating over collections (result sets) we propose to either use cursors
(see <<160>>) or simple hypertext control links (see <<161>>). To implement
these in a consistent way, we have defined a response page object pattern with
the following field semantics:

* [[self]]{self}:the link or cursor pointing to the same page.
* [[first]]{first}: the link or cursor pointing to the first page.
* [[prev]]{prev}: the link or cursor pointing to the previous page. 
It is not provided, if it is the first page. 
* [[next]]{next}: the link or cursor pointing to the next page.
It is not provided, if it is the last page. 
* [[last]]{last}: the link or cursor pointing to the last page.

Pagination responses should contain the following additional array field to
transport the page content:

* [[items]]{items}: array of resources, holding all the items of the current
  page ({items} may be replaced by a resource name).

To simplify user experience, the applied query filters may be returned using
the following field (see also {GET-with-body}):

* [[query]]{query}: object containing the query filters applied in the search
  request to filter the collection resource.

As Result, the standard response page using <<160, cursors>> or <<161,
pagination links>> may be defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
ResponsePage:
  type: object
  required:
    - items
  properties:
    self:
      description: Pagination link|cursor pointing to the current page.
      type: string
      format: uri|cursor
    first:
      description: Pagination link|cursor pointing to the first page.
      type: string
      format: uri|cursor
    prev:
      description: Pagination link|cursor pointing to the previous page.
      type: string
      format: uri|cursor
    next:
      description: Pagination link|cursor pointing to the next page.
      type: string
      format: uri|cursor
    last:
      description: Pagination link|cursor pointing to the last page.
      type: string
      format: uri|cursor

    query:
      description: >
        Object containing the query filters applied to the collection resource.
      type: object
      properties: ...

    items:
      description: Array of collection items.
      type: array
      required: false
      items:
        type: ...
----

*Note:* While you may support cursors for {next}, {prev}, {first}, {last}, and
{self}, it is best practice to replace these with pagination links -- see
<<161>>.


[#161]
== {SHOULD} use pagination links

To simplify client design, APIs should support <<165, simplified hypertext
controls>> as standard pagination links where applicable:

[source,json]
----
{
  "self": "http://my-service.zalandoapis.com/resources?cursor=<self-position>",
  "first": "http://my-service.zalandoapis.com/resources?cursor=<first-position>",
  "prev": "http://my-service.zalandoapis.com/resources?cursor=<previous-position>",
  "next": "http://my-service.zalandoapis.com/resources?cursor=<next-position>",
  "last": "http://my-service.zalandoapis.com/resources?cursor=<last-position>",
  "query": {
    "query-param-<1>": ...,
    "query-param-<n>": ...
  },
  "items": [...]
}
----

[#254]
== {SHOULD} avoid a total result count

In pagination responses you should generally avoid providing a _total result
count_, since calculating it is a costly operation that is usually not required
by clients. Counting the total number of results for complex queries usually
requires a full scan of all involved indexes, as it is difficult to calculate
and cache it in advance. While this is only an implementation detail, it is
important to consider that providing these total counts over the life-span
of a service might become expensive as the data set grows over time.

As clients may integrate against these counts over time alongside data
set growth, removing them will be more difficult than not providing them
in the first place.

If your consumer really requires a total result count in the response, you may
support this requirement via the {Prefer} header adding the directive
`return=total-count` (see also <<181>>).
