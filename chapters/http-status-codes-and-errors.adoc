= HTTP status codes and errors


[#151]
== {MUST} specify success and error responses

APIs should define the functional, business view and abstract from
implementation aspects. Success and error responses are a vital part to
define how an API is used correctly.

Therefore, you must define **all** success and service specific error
responses in your API specification. Both are part of the interface definition
and provide important information for service clients to handle standard as
well as exceptional situations. 


**Hint:** In most cases it is not useful to document all technical errors,
especially if they are not under control of the service provider. Thus unless
a response code conveys application-specific functional semantics or is used
in a none standard way that requires additional explanation, multiple error
response specifications can be combined using the following pattern
(see also <<#234>>):

[source,yaml]
----
responses:
  ...
  default:
    description: error occurred - see status code and problem object for more information.
    content:
      "application/problem+json":
        schema:
          $ref: 'https://opensource.dailypay.com/restful-api-guidelines/models/problem-1.0.1.yaml#/Problem'
----

API designers should also think about a **troubleshooting board** as part of
the associated online API documentation. It provides information and handling
guidance on application-specific errors and is referenced via links from the
API specification. This can reduce service support tasks and contribute to
service client and provider performance.


[#243]
== {MUST} use official HTTP status codes

You must only use official HTTP status codes consistently with their intended
semantics. Official HTTP status codes are defined via RFC standards and
registered in the https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml[IANA
Status Code Registry]. Main RFC standards are {RFC-7231}#section-6[RFC7231]
and {RFC-6585}[RFC 6585] (and there are upcoming new ones, e.g.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-05[draft
legally-restricted-status]). An overview on the official error codes provides
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes[Wikipedia: HTTP status
codes] (which also lists some unofficial status codes, e.g. defined by popular
web servers like Nginx, that we do not suggest to use).


[#150]
== {SHOULD} only use most common HTTP status codes

The most commonly used codes are best understood and listed below as subset of
the official HTTP status codes and consistent with their semantics in the RFCs.
We avoid less commonly used codes that easily create misconceptions due to
less familar semantics and API specific interpretations.

**Important:** As long as your HTTP status code usage is well covered by the
semantic defined here, you should not describe it to avoid an overload with
common sense information and the risk of inconsistent definitions. Only if the
HTTP status code is not in the list below or its usage requires additional
information aside the well defined semantic, the API specification must provide
a clear description of the HTTP status code in the response.

Gone - resource does not exist any longer, e.g. when accessing a
resource that has intentionally been deleted.
|{ALL}

[#220]
== {MUST} use most specific HTTP status codes

You must use the most specific HTTP status code when returning information 
about your request processing status or error situations.


[#152]
== {MUST} use code 207 for batch or bulk requests

Some APIs are required to provide either _batch_ or _bulk_ requests using
{POST} for performance reasons, i.e. for communication and processing
efficiency. In this case services may be in need to signal multiple response
codes for each part of an batch or bulk request. As HTTP does not provide
proper guidance for handling batch/bulk requests and responses, we herewith
define the following approach:

* A batch or bulk request *always* responds with HTTP status code {207}
  unless a non-item-specific failure occurs.

* A batch or bulk request *may* return {4xx}/{5xx} status codes, if the
  failure is non-item-specific and cannot be restricted to individual items of
  the batch or bulk request, e.g. in case of overload situations or general
  service failures.

* A batch or bulk response with status code {207} *always* returns as payload
  a multi-status response containing item specific status and/or monitoring
  information for each part of the batch or bulk request.

**Note:** These rules apply _even in the case_ that processing of all
individual parts _fail_ or each part is executed _asynchronously_!

The rules are intended to allow clients to act on batch and bulk responses in
a consistent way by inspecting the individual results. We explicitly reject
the option to apply {200} for a completely successful batch as proposed in
Nakadi's https://nakadi.io/manual.html#/event-types/name/events_post[`POST
/event-types/{name}/events`] as short cut without inspecting the result, as we
want to avoid  risks and expect clients to handle partial
batch failures anyway.

The bulk or batch response may look as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
BatchOrBulkResponse:
  description: batch response object.
  type: object
  properties:
    items:
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          id:
            description: Identifier of batch or bulk request item.
            type: string
          status:
            description: >
              Response status value. A number or extensible enum describing
              the execution status of the batch or bulk request items.
            type: string
            x-extensible-enum: [...] 
          description:
            description: >
              Human readable status description and containing additional
              context information about failures etc.
            type: string
        required: [id, status]
----

*Note*: while a _batch_ defines a collection of requests triggering
independent processes, a _bulk_ defines a collection of independent
resources created or updated together in one request. With respect to
response processing this distinction normally does not matter.


[#153]
== {MUST} use code 429 with headers for rate limits

APIs that wish to manage the request rate of clients must use the {429} (Too
Many Requests) response code, if the client exceeded the request rate (see
{RFC-6585}[RFC 6585]). Such responses must also contain header information
providing further details to the client. There are two approaches a service
can take for header information:

* Return a {Retry-After} header indicating how long the client ought to wait
  before making a follow-up request. The Retry-After header can contain a HTTP
  date value to retry after or the number of seconds to delay. Either is
  acceptable but APIs should prefer to use a delay in seconds.
* Return a trio of `X-RateLimit` headers. These headers (described below) allow
  a server to express a service level in the form of a number of allowing
  requests within a given window of time and when the window is reset.

The `X-RateLimit` headers are:

* `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests that the client is
  allowed to make in this window.
* `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests allowed in the current
  window.
* `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The relative time in seconds when the rate limit window
  will be reset. **Beware** that this is different to Github and Twitter's
  usage of a header with the same name which is using UTC epoch seconds
  instead.

The reason to allow both approaches is that APIs can have different
needs. Retry-After is often sufficient for general load handling and
request throttling scenarios and notably, does not strictly require the
concept of a calling entity such as a tenant or named account. In turn
this allows resource owners to minimise the amount of state they have to
carry with respect to client requests. The 'X-RateLimit' headers are
suitable for scenarios where clients are associated with pre-existing
account or tenancy structures. 'X-RateLimit' headers are generally
returned on every request and not just on a 429, which implies the
service implementing the API is carrying sufficient state to track the
number of requests made within a given window for each named entity.


[#176]
== {MUST} support problem JSON

{RFC-7807}[RFC 7807] defines a Problem JSON object using the media type
`application/problem+json` to provide an extensible human and machine readable
failure information beyond the HTTP response status code to transports the
failure kind (`type` / `title`) and the failure cause and location (`instant` /
`detail`). To make best use of this additional failure information, every
endpoints must be capable of returning a Problem JSON on client usage errors
({4xx} status codes) as well as server side processing errors ({5xx} status
codes).

*Note:* Clients must be robust and *not rely* on a Problem JSON object
being returned, since (a) failure responses may be created by infrastructure
components not aware of this guideline or (b) service may be unable to comply
with this guidelines in certain error situations.

*Hint:* The media type `application/problem+json` is often not implemented as
a subset of `application/json` by libraries and services! Thus clients need to
include `application/problem+json` in the {Accept}-Header to trigger delivery
of the extended failure information.

The OpenAPI schema definition of the Problem JSON object can be found
https://opensource.dailypay.com/restful-api-guidelines/models/problem-1.0.1.yaml[on
GitHub]. You can reference it by using:

[source,yaml]
----
responses:
  503:
    description: Service Unavailable
    content:
      "application/problem+json":
        schema:
          $ref: 'https://opensource.dailypay.com/restful-api-guidelines/models/problem-1.0.1.yaml#/Problem'
----

You may define custom problem types as extensions of the Problem JSON object
if your API needs to return specific, additional, and more detailed error
information.

*Note:* Problem `type` and `instance` identifiers in our APIs are not meant
to be resolved. {RFC-7807}[RFC 7807] encourages that problem types are URI
references that point to human-readable documentation, *but* we deliberately
decided against that, as all important parts of the API must be documented
using <<101, OpenAPI>> anyway. In addition, URLs tend to be fragile and not
very stable over longer periods because of organizational and documentation
changes and descriptions might easily get out of sync.

In order to stay compatible with {RFC-7807}[RFC 7807] we proposed to use
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.1[relative URI references]
usually defined by `absolute-path [ '?' query ] [ '#' fragment ]` as simplified
identifiers in `type` and `instance` fields:

* `/problems/out-of-stock`
* `/problems/insufficient-funds`
* `/problems/user-deactivated`
* `/problems/connection-error#read-timeout`

*Hint:* The use of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.3[absolute
URIs] is not forbidden but strongly discouraged. If you use absolute URIs,
please reference https://opensource.dailypay.com/restful-api-guidelines/models/problem-1.0.0.yaml#/Problem[problem-1.0.0.yaml#/Problem] instead.


[#177]
== {MUST} not expose stack traces

Stack traces contain implementation details that are not part of an API,
and on which clients should never rely. Moreover, stack traces can leak
sensitive information that partners and third parties are not allowed to
receive and may disclose insights about vulnerabilities to attackers.
