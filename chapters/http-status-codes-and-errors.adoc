[#151]
== {MUST} Specify Success and Error Responses

APIs should define the functional, business view and abstract from
implementation aspects. Success and error responses are a vital part to
define how an API is used correctly.

Therefore, you must define **all** success and service specific error
responses in your API specification. Both are part of the interface definition
and provide important information for service clients to handle standard as
well as exceptional situations. 


**Hint:** In most cases it is not useful to document all technical errors,
especially if they are not under control of the service provider. Thus unless
a response code conveys application-specific functional semantics or is used
in a none standard way that requires additional explanation, multiple error
response specifications can be combined using the following pattern:

[source,yaml]
----
responses:
  ...
  default:
    description: error occurred - see status code and problem object for more information.
    schema:
      $ref: 'https://zalando.github.io/problem/schema.yaml#/Problem'
----

API designers should also think about a **troubleshooting board** as part of
the associated online API documentation. It provides information and handling
guidance on application-specific errors and is referenced via links from the
API specification. This can reduce service support tasks and contribute to
service client and provider performance.


[#150]
== {MUST} Use Standard HTTP Status Codes

You must only use standardized HTTP status codes consistently with their
intended semantics. You must not invent new HTTP status codes.

RFC standards define ~60 different HTTP status codes with specific semantics 
(mainly https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6[RFC7231] and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585[RFC-6585]) â€” and there are upcoming
new ones, e.g.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-05[draft
legally-restricted-status]. See overview on all error codes on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes[Wikipedia] or
via https://httpstatuses.com/) also inculding 'unofficial codes', e.g. used
by popular web servers like Nginx.

Below we list the most commonly used and best understood HTTP status codes,
consistent with their semantic in the RFCs. APIs should only use these to
prevent misconceptions that arise from less commonly used HTTP status codes.

**Important:** As long as your HTTP status code usage is well covered by the
semantic defined here, you should not describe it to avoid an overload with
common sense information and the risk of inconsistent definitions. Only if the
HTTP status code is not in the list below or its usage requires additional
information aside the well defined semantic, the API specification must provide
a clear description of the HTTP status code in the response.

[[success-codes]]
=== Success Codes

[cols="10%,70%,20%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Meaning |Methods
|200 |OK - this is the standard success response |All

|201 |Created - Returned on successful entity creation. You are free to
return either an empty response or the created resource in conjunction
with the Location header. (More details found in the
<<common-headers>>.) _Always_ set the Location header. |POST, PUT

|202 |Accepted - The request was successful and will be processed
asynchronously. |POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

|204 |No content - There is no response body |PUT, DELETE, PATCH

|207 |Multi-Status - The response body contains multiple status
informations for different parts of a batch/bulk request. See
<<152>>. |POST
|=======================================================================

[[redirection-codes]]
=== Redirection Codes

[cols="10%,70%,20%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Meaning |Methods
|301 |Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be
directed to the given URI. |All

|303 |See Other - The response to the request can be found under another
URI using a GET method. |PATCH, POST, PUT, DELETE

|304 |Not Modified - resource has not been modified since the date or
version passed via request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match.
|GET
|=======================================================================

[[client-side-error-codes]]
=== Client Side Error Codes

[cols="10%,70%,20%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Meaning |Methods
|400 |Bad request - generic / unknown error. 
Should also be delivered in case of input payload fails business logic validation. |All

|401 |Unauthorized - the users must log in (this often means
"Unauthenticated") |All

|403 |Forbidden - the user is not authorized to use this resource |All

|404 |Not found - the resource is not found |All

|405 |Method Not Allowed - the method is not supported, see OPTIONS |All

|406 |Not Acceptable - resource can only generate content not acceptable
according to the Accept headers sent in the request |All

|408 |Request timeout - the server times out waiting for the resource
|All

|409 |Conflict - request cannot be completed due to conflict, e.g. when
two clients try to create the same resource or if there are concurrent,
conflicting updates |POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

|410 |Gone - resource does not exist any longer, e.g. when accessing a
resource that has intentionally been deleted |All

|412 |Precondition Failed - returned for conditional requests, e.g.
If-Match if the condition failed. Used for optimistic locking. |PUT,
DELETE, PATCH

|415 |Unsupported Media Type - e.g. clients sends request body without
content type |POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

|423 |Locked - Pessimistic locking, e.g. processing states |PUT, DELETE,
PATCH

|428 |Precondition Required - server requires the request to be
conditional (e.g. to make sure that the "lost update problem" is
avoided). |All

|429 |Too many requests - the client does not consider rate limiting and
sent too many requests. See <<153>>. |All
|=======================================================================

[[server-side-error-codes]]
=== Server Side Error Codes:

[cols="10%,70%,20%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Meaning |Methods
|500 |Internal Server Error - a generic error indication for an
unexpected server execution problem (here, client retry may be sensible)
|All

|501 |Not Implemented - server cannot fulfill the request (usually
implies future availability, e.g. new feature). |All

|503 |Service Unavailable - server is (temporarily) not available (e.g.
due to overload) -- client retry may be sensible. |All
|=======================================================================

[#220]
== {MUST} Use Most Specific HTTP Status Codes

You must use the most specific HTTP status code when returning information 
about your request processing status or error situations.

[#152]
== {MUST} Use Code 207 for Batch or Bulk Requests

Some APIs are required to provide either _batch_ or _bulk_ requests
using POST for performance reasons, i.e. for communication and
processing efficiency. In this case services may be in need to signal
multiple response codes for each part of an batch or bulk request. As
HTTP does not provide proper guidance for handling batch/bulk requests
and responses, we herewith define the following approach:

* A batch or bulk request *always* has to respond with HTTP status code
*207*, unless it encounters a generic or unexpected failure before
looking at individual parts.
* A batch or bulk response with status code 207 *always* returns a
multi-status object containing sufficient status and/or monitoring
information for each part of the batch or bulk request.
* A batch or bulk request may result in a status code 400/500, only if
the service encounters a failure before looking at individual parts or,
if an unanticipated failure occurs.

The before rules apply _even in the case_ that processing of all
individual part _fail_ or each part is executed _asynchronously_! They
are intended to allow clients to act on batch and bulk responses by
inspecting the individual results in a consistent way.

*Note*: while a _batch_ defines a collection of requests triggering
independent processes, a _bulk_ defines a collection of independent
resources created or updated together in one request. With respect to
response processing this distinction normally does not matter.

[#153]
== {MUST} Use Code 429 with Headers for Rate Limits

APIs that wish to manage the request rate of clients must use the
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585['429 Too Many Requests'] response
code if the client exceeded the request rate and therefore the request
can't be fulfilled. Such responses must also contain header information
providing further details to the client. There are two approaches a
service can take for header information:

* Return a
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3['Retry-After'] header
indicating how long the client ought to wait before making a follow-up
request. The Retry-After header can contain a HTTP date value to retry
after or the number of seconds to delay. Either is acceptable but APIs
should prefer to use a delay in seconds.
* Return a trio of 'X-RateLimit' headers. These headers (described
below) allow a server to express a service level in the form of a number
of allowing requests within a given window of time and when the window
is reset.

The 'X-RateLimit' headers are:

* `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests that the client is
allowed to make in this window.
* `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests allowed in the current
window.
* `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The relative time in seconds when the rate limit
window will be reset. **Beware** that this is different to Github and
Twitter's usage of a header with the same name which is using UTC epoch
seconds instead.

The reason to allow both approaches is that APIs can have different
needs. Retry-After is often sufficient for general load handling and
request throttling scenarios and notably, does not strictly require the
concept of a calling entity such as a tenant or named account. In turn
this allows resource owners to minimise the amount of state they have to
carry with respect to client requests. The 'X-RateLimit' headers are
suitable for scenarios where clients are associated with pre-existing
account or tenancy structures. 'X-RateLimit' headers are generally
returned on every request and not just on a 429, which implies the
service implementing the API is carrying sufficient state to track the
number of requests made within a given window for each named entity.


[#176]
== {MUST} Use Problem JSON

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807[RFC 7807] defines a Problem JSON object and 
the media type `application/problem+json`. Operations should return it (together with
a suitable status code) when any problem occurred during processing and
you can give more details than the status code itself can supply,
whether it be caused by the client or the server (i.e. both for 4xx or
5xx error codes).

The Open API schema definition of the Problem JSON object can be found
https://zalando.github.io/problem/schema.yaml[on github]. You can
reference it by using:

[source,yaml]
----
responses:
  503:
    description: Service Unavailable
    schema:
      $ref: 'https://zalando.github.io/problem/schema.yaml#/Problem'
----

You may define custom problem types as extension of the Problem JSON object 
if your API need to return specific additional error detail information.


**Hint** for backward compatibility:
A previous version of this guideline (before the publication of 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807[RFC 7807]
and the registration of the media type) told to return
custom variant of the media type `application/x.problem+json`. 
Servers for APIs defined before this change should pay attention to the
`Accept` header sent by the client and set the `Content-Type` header of
the problem response correspondingly. Clients of such APIs should accept
both media types.


[#177]
== {MUST} Do not expose Stack Traces

Stack traces contain implementation details that are not part of an API,
and on which clients should never rely. Moreover, stack traces can leak
sensitive information that partners and third parties are not allowed to
receive and may disclose insights about vulnerabilities to attackers.
