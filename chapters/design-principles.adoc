== API Design Principles

Comparing SOA web service interfacing style of SOAP vs. REST, the former
tend to be centered around operations that are usually use-case specific
and specialized. In contrast, REST is centered around business (data)
entities exposed as resources that are identified via URIs and can be
manipulated via standardized CRUD-like methods using different
representations, and hypermedia. RESTful APIs
tend to be less use-case specific and comes with less rigid client /
server coupling and are more suitable for an ecosystem of (core) services 
providing a platform of APIs to build diverse new business services. 
We apply the RESTful web service principles to all kind of application 
(micro-) service components, independently from whether they provide 
functionality via the internet or intranet. 

* We prefer REST-based APIs with JSON payloads
* We prefer systems to be truly RESTful
footnote:fielding-restful[Per definition of R.Fielding REST APIs have to support
HATEOAS (maturity level 3). Our guidelines do not strongly advocate for
full REST compliance, but limited hypermedia usage, e.g. for pagination
(see <<hypermedia>>).
However, we still use the term "RESTful API", due to the absence
of an alternative established term and to keep it like the very majority
of web service industry that also use the term for their REST
approximations — in fact, in today's industry full HATEOAS compliant
APIs are a very rare exception.]

An important principle for API design and usage is Postel's
Law, aka http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle[The
Robustness Principle] (see also https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122[RFC 1122]):

* Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you send

[[api-as-a-product]]
== API as a Product

As a company we want to deliver products to our (internal and external)
customers which can be consumed like a service.

Platform products provide their functionality via (public) APIs; hence,
the design of our APIs should be based on the API as a Product
principle:

* Treat your API as product and act like a product owner
* Put yourself into the place of your customers; be an advocate for
  their needs
* Emphasize simplicity, comprehensibility, and usability of APIs to
make them irresistible for client engineers
* Actively improve and maintain API consistency over the long term
* Make use of customer feedback and provide service level support

Embracing 'API as a Product' facilitates a service ecosystem which can 
be evolved more easily, and used to experiment quickly with new business 
ideas by recombining core capabilities. 
It makes the difference between agile, innovative product service 
business built on a platform of APIs and ordinary enterprise integration business
where APIs are provided as "appendix" of existing products to support system integration
and optimised for local server-side realization. 

Understand the concrete use cases of your customers and carefully check 
the trade-offs of your API design variants with a product mindset. Avoid short-term 
implementation optimizations at the expense of unnecessary client side
obligations, and have a high attention on API quality and client
developer experience.

API as a Product is closely related to our <<100,API First principle>>
(see next chapter) which is more focused on how we engineer high quality APIs.



[[api-first]]
== API First 

API First example:
https://github.com/zalando/engineering-principles[engineering
and architecture principles]. In a nutshell API First requires two
aspects:

* define APIs first, before coding its implementation, using a standard specification
language
* get early review feedback from peers and client developers

By defining APIs outside the code, we want to facilitate early review
feedback and also a development discipline that focus service interface
design on...

* profound understanding of the domain and required functionality
* generalized business entities / resources, i.e. avoidance of use case
specific APIs
* clear separation of WHAT vs. HOW concerns, i.e. abstraction from
implementation aspects — APIs should be stable even if we replace
complete service implementation including its underlying technology
stack

Moreover, API definitions with standardized specification format also
facilitate...

* single source of truth for the API specification; it is a crucial part
of a contract between service provider and client users
* infrastructure tooling for API discovery, API GUIs, API documents,
automated quality checks

Elements of API First are also this API Guidelines and a standardized 
API review process as to get early review feedback from
peers and client developers. Peer review is important for us to get high
quality APIs, to enable architectural and design alignment and to
supported development of client applications decoupled from service
provider engineering life cycle.

It is important to learn, that API First is *not in conflict with the
agile development principles* that we love. Service applications should
evolve incrementally — and so its APIs. Of course, our API specification
will and should evolve iteratively in different cycles; however, each
starting with draft status and _early_ team and peer review feedback.
API may change and profit from implementation concerns and automated
testing feedback. API evolution during development life cycle may
include breaking changes for not yet productive features and as long as
we have aligned the changes with the clients. Hence, API First does
_not_ mean that you must have 100% domain and requirement understanding
and can never produce code before you have defined the complete API and
get it confirmed by peer review. On the other hand, API First obviously
is in conflict with the bad practice of publishing API definition and
asking for peer review after the service integration or even the service
productive operation has started. It is crucial to request and get early
feedback — as early as possible, but not before the API changes are
comprehensive with focus to the next evolution step and have a certain
quality (including API Guideline compliance), already confirmed via team
internal reviews.
