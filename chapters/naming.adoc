== {MUST-SHOULD} Use Functional Naming Schema

Functional naming is a powerful, yet easy way to align global resources as
_host_, _permission_, and _event names_ within an the application landscape. It
helps to preserve uniqueness of names while giving readers meaningful context
information about the addressed component. Besides, the most important aspect
is, that it allows to keep APIs stable in the case of technical and
organizational changes (Valimail for example maintains an internal naming convention).

To make use of this advantages for APIs with a larger <<219, audience>> we
strongly recommended to follow the functional naming schema for <<224,
hostnames>>, <<215, permission names>>, and <<213, event names>> in APIs as
follows:

[cols="25%,75%,options="header"]
|=========================================================
| *Functional Naming* | *Audience*
| *must*   | external-public, external-partner
| *should* | company-internal, business-unit-internal
| *may*    | component-internal
|=========================================================

To conduct the functional naming schema, a unique `functional-name` is assigned
to each functional component. It is built of the domain name of the functional
group the component is belonging to and a unique a short identifier for the
functional component itself:

[source,bnf]
----
<functional-name>       ::= <functional-domain>-<functional-component>
<functional-domain>     ::= [a-z][a-z0-9]*  -- managed functional group of components
<functional-component>  ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]* -- name of owning functional component
----

*Internal Hint*:  Use the simple 
https://github.bus.zalan.do/team-architecture/functional-component-registry[functional
name registry (internal link)] to register your functional name before using
it. The registry is a centralized infrastructure service to ensure uniqueness
of your functional names (and available domains) and to support hostname DNS
resolution.

Please see the following rules for detailed functional naming patterns:

* <<224>>
// * <<225>>
* <<213>>

[#224]
== {MUST} Follow Naming Convention for Hostnames

Hostnames in APIs must, respectively should conform to the functional naming
depending on the <<219, audience>> as follows (see <<223>> for details and
`<functional-name>` definition):

[source,bnf]
-----
<hostname>             ::= <functional-hostname> | <application-hostname>

<functional-hostname>  ::= <functional-name>.valimailapis.com
TODO: dewayne.richardson ?? ^^
-----

The following application specific legacy convention is *only* allowed for
hostnames of <<219, component-internal>> APIs:

[source,bnf]
-----
<application-hostname> ::= <application-id>.<organization-unit>.zalan.do
<application-id>       ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- application identifier
<organization-id>      ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- organization unit identifier, e.g. team identifier
-----

[#129]
== {MUST} Use lowercase separate words with hyphens for Path Segments

Example:

[source,http]
----
/shipment-orders/{shipment-order-id}
----

This applies to concrete path segments and not the names of path
parameters. For example `{shipment_order_id}` would be ok as a path
parameter.

[#130]
== {MUST} Use snake_case (never camelCase) for Query Parameters

Examples:

[source]
----
customer_number, order_id, billing_address
----

[#132]
== {SHOULD} Prefer Hyphenated-Pascal-Case for HTTP header Fields

This is for consistency in your documentation (most other headers follow
this convention). Avoid camelCase (without hyphens). Exceptions are
common abbreviations like "ID."

Examples:

[source,http]
----
Accept-Encoding
Apply-To-Redirect-Ref
Disposition-Notification-Options
Original-Message-ID
----

See also: {RFC-7230}#page-22[HTTP Headers are case-insensitive (RFC 7230)].

See <<common-headers>> and <<proprietary-headers>> sections for more guidance
on HTTP headers.

[#134]
== {MUST} Pluralize Resource Names

Usually, a collection of resource instances is provided (at least API
should be ready here). The special case of a resource singleton is a
collection with cardinality 1.

[#135]
== {SHOULD} Not Use /api as Base Path

In most cases, all resources provided by a service are part of the
public API, and therefore should be made available under the root "/"
base path.

If the service should also support non-public, internal APIs
— for specific operational support functions, for example — we encourage 
you to maintain two different API specifications and provide
<<219, API audience>>. For both APIs, you should not use `/api` as base path.

We see API's base path as a part of deployment variant configuration.
Therefore, this information has to be declared in the
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#server-object[server object].

[#136]
== {MUST} Avoid Trailing Slashes

The trailing slash must not have specific semantics. Resource paths must
deliver the same results whether they have the trailing slash or not.

[#137]
== {MUST} Stick to Conventional Query Parameters

If you provide query support for searching, sorting, filtering, and
paginating, you must stick to the following naming conventions:

* [[q]]{q}: default query parameter, e.g. used by browser tab completion;
  should have an entity specific alias, e.g. sku.
* [[sort]]{sort}: comma-separated list of fields (as defined by <<154>>) to
  define the sort order. To indicate sorting direction, fields may be prefixed
  with `+` (ascending) or `-` (descending), e.g. /sales-orders?sort=+id.
* [[fields]]{fields}: field name expression to retrieve only a subset of fields
  of a resource. See <<157>> below.
* [[embed]]{embed}: field name expression to expand or embedded sub-entities,
  e.g. inside of an article entity, expand silhouette code into the silhouette
  object. Implementing {embed} correctly is difficult, so do it with care.
  See <<158>> below.
* [[offset]]{offset}: numeric offset of the first element provided on a page
  representing a collection request. See <<pagination>> section below.
* [[cursor]]{cursor}: an opaque pointer to a page, never to be inspected or
  constructed by clients. It usually (encrypted) encodes the page position,
  i.e. the identifier of the first or last page element, the pagination
  direction, and the applied query filters to recreate the collection. See
  <<160, pagination>> section below.
* [[limit]]{limit}: client suggested limit to restrict the number of entries on
  a page. See <<pagination>> section below.
