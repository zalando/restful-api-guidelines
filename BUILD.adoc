= Build

== Build and test HTML site

[source,bash]
----
make all
----

**Note:** While we have removed the `epub` and `pdf` from our published pages,
the targets are still available for experimenting.

Since http://asciidoctor.org/docs[asciidoctor] does not support a linter yet,
we have setup https://unpkg.com/browse/markdownlint-cli@0.27.1/README.md[markdownlint]
as an experiment to support coding standards. To install and check for
violations use

[source,bash]
----
make lint
----

If linting with the suggested rules proves helpful we will integrate this
target into the a `pre-commit`-hook to enforce a common style and append it
to the `all`-target.

**Note:** We have currently not tested the capability of `markdownlint` (or
`make format`) to fix linter violations.

== Watch for changes and rebuild

[source,bash]
----
make watch
----

It uses https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec[watchexec] to watch for
changes in the `.adoc` (and `.css`) files to rebuild the html on save.

== Find next Rule ID

If you want to create a new rule, you need to define a new rule identifier. Use
the following command to find the next unused rule identifier.

[source,bash]
----
make next-rule-id
----

== Generate Custom CSS

In order to generate custom CSS we have to use
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#stylesheet-factory[`stylesheet-factory`]

This script clones the factory repository, installs the dependencies and
generates CSS based in the `zalando.scss`

[source,bash]
----
.scripts/build-css.sh
