== When to contribute?

=== Minor improvements

Minor improvements like grammar, spelling or link fixes are always welcome â€“ both
from Zalando employees and from outsiders.

Just open a pull request. The maintainers will review it and usually merge.
If you see something wrong, but don't know how to fix it, please open an issue.

=== Major rule changes

For major changes to an existing rule (or adding a new rule), a discussion
and decision by Zalando's API guild is needed.

For this, we generally only consider arguments which also apply to Zalando's
situation, as these are Zalando's guidelines, not generic guidelines for everyone.

So such changes typically (but not exclusively) will be suggested by Zalando employees.
Feel free to open an issue first outlining the need, or (if you are an employee) contact us in our
internal #guild-api chat, or come to one of our bi-weekly meetings to discuss this.

After we have some general alignment on what kind of rule (change) we want,
someone will be assigned to write a PR. We welcome volunteers (please note
in your issue that you volunteer, if you can't be in the meeting).

You may also directly create a PR, but to avoid spending time on big changes
which won't be accepted, we recommend to start with an issue.

== How to Contribute?

=== Pull requests only

*DON'T* push to the master branch directly. _(This mainly applies to people with write/admin access.)_ Always use pull requests and
let people discuss changes in pull request.

Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been
concluded and at least 2 reviewers gave their approvals.
_(This should be automatically enforced by Zalando's ComPR tool, but if it
  doesn't work, please don't circumvent it.)_

=== Changelog for major changes

When your pull request does major changes, please also add an entry to
the changelog.

=== Rule IDs

Each of the rules has a unique ID. A Rule ID is immutable and durable. It
doesn't change until the content of the rule changes significantly so that
it does not make sense to identify it with the old Rule ID.

In order to ensure the uniqueness of the IDs you can use `make check-rules`.
Preferably, you add this command as a `pre-commit` hook to your local
repository.

To generate a new unique Rule ID simply run `make next-rule-id`.
