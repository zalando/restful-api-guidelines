== Pull requests only

*DON'T* push to the master branch directly. Always use pull requests and
let people discuss changes in pull request.

Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been
concluded and at least 2 reviewers gave their approvals.

== Changelog for major changes

When your pull request does major changes, please also add an entry to
the changelog.

== Rule Id

Each of the rules has an unique Id. Rule Id is immutable and durable. It
doesn't change until the content of the rule changes significantly.

In order to ensure the uniqueness of the Ids you can use
link:./check_uniqueness_of_rule_ids.sh[this script]. Preferably, you add this script
as a `pre-commit` hook to your local repository:

[source,bash]
----
cp check_uniqueness_of_rule_ids.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
----

To generate a new unique (unused) Rule Id simply run `./new_rule_id.sh`.
