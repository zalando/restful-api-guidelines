# Standard request headers

Accept-Encoding:
  name: Accept-Encoding
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Accept-Encoding** indicates the content encoding (usually a
    compression algorithm) the client understands. The server selects one of
    the proposed encodings and returns his choice in the **Content-Encoding**
    response header.

    Supported compression algorithms of the server are [**gzip**][gzip] and
    **identity**, but other encodings from list below may be support too:

    * **gzip** - a compression format that uses [Lempel-Ziv coding][gzip]
      (LZ77) with a 32-bit CRC.
    * **compress** - a format using the [Lempel-Ziv-Welch][lzw] (LZW)
      algorithm.
    * **deflate** - A compression format that uses the [zlib][zlib] structure
      with the [deflate][deflate] compression algorithm.
    * **br** - a compression format that uses the [Brotli][brotli] algorithm.
    * **identity** - the identity function without modification or compression
      used to indicate unchanged responses. This value is always considered as
      acceptable, even if omitted.

    The server may choose not to compress the body of the response, if the
    identity value is acceptable, e.g. if the content is already compressed
    (e.g. for JPEG content), or if the server is missing resources to perform
    the compression operation.

    **Note:** A client is allowed to explicitly forbid the identity value by
    setting **identity;q=0** or **\*;q=0**, however, the server in return may
    respond with a **406** (Not Acceptable) error.

    See [RFC 9110 Section 12.5.3][rfc-9110-12.5.3] as well as [API Guideline
    Rule #156][api-156] for further details.

If-Match:
  name: If-Match
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **If-Match** header field is used to declare a list of identifiers that
    are required to match the current resource version identifier in at least
    one position as a pre-condition for executing the request on the server
    side. This behavior is used to validate and reject optimistic updates, by
    checking if the resource version a consumer has based his changes on is
    outdated on arrival of the change request to prevent lost updates.

    If the pre-condition fails the server will respond with status code **412**
    (Precondition Failed). See [RFC 9110 Section 13.1.1][rfc-9110-13.1.1] as
    well as [API Guideline Rule #182][api-182] for further details.

If-None-Match:
  name: If-None-Match
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **If-None-Match header** field is used to declare a list of identifiers
    that are required to fail matching all the current resource version
    identifiers as a pre-condition for executing the request on the server
    side. This is especially used in conjunction with an **\*** (asterix) that
    is matching all possible resource identifiers to ensure the initial
    creation of a resource. Other use cases are possible but rare.

    If the pre-condition fails the server will respond with status code **412**
    (Precondition Failed). See [RFC 9110 Section 13.1.2][rfc-9110-13.1.2] as
    well as [API Guideline Rule #182][api-182] for further details.

Prefer:
  # Do not import this schema directly, since processing directives are usually
  # highly customized. Instead, copy the schema to your API and adjust it to
  # your needs.
  name: Prefer
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Prefer** header indicates that a particular server behavior is
    preferred by the client, but is not required for successful completion of
    the request (see [RFC 7240][rfc-7240]. The following behaviors are
    supported by this API:

    * **respond-async** is used to suggest the server to respond as fast as
      possible asynchronously using **202** (Accepted) instead of waiting for
      the result.
    * **return=<minimal|representation>** is used to suggest the server to
      return using **204** (No Content) without resource (minimal) or using
      **200** or **201** with resource (representation) in the response body on
      success.
    * **return=<total-count>** is used to suggest the server to return a total
      result count in a collection requests supporting pagination. Since this
      is a costly operation, it should be used with care, and the service may
      decide to ignore this request.
    * **wait=<delta-seconds>** is used to suggest a maximum time the server has
      time to process the request synchronously.
    * **handling=<strict|lenient>** is used to suggest the server to be strict
      and report error conditions or lenient, i.e. robust and try to continue,
      if possible.

    See [RFC 7240][rfc-7240] as well as [API Guideline Rule #181][api-181]

Idempotency-Key:
  name: Idempotency-Key
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Idempotency-Key** is a free identifier created by the client to
    identify a request. It is used by the service to identify repeated request
    to ensure idempotent behavior by sending the same (or a similar) response
    without executing the request a second time.

    Clients should be careful as any subsequent requests with the same key may
    return the same response without further check. Thus, it is recommended to
    use a UUID version 4 (random) or any other random string with enough
    entropy to avoid collisions.

    Keys expire after 24 hours. Clients are responsible to stay within this
    limit, if they require idempotent behavior.

# Standard response headers


Content-Encoding:
  name: Content-Encoding
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Content-Encoding** header lists any encoding (usually a compression
    algorithm) applied to the message payload - in execution order. This allows
    the recipient to decode the content in order to obtain the original payload
    format.

    Supported compression algorithms of the server are [**gzip**][gzip] and
    **identity**, but other encoding from list below may be support too:

    * **gzip** - a compression format that uses [Lempel-Ziv coding][gzip]
      (LZ77) with a 32-bit CRC.
    * **compress** - a format using the [Lempel-Ziv-Welch][lzw] (LZW)
      algorithm.
    * **deflate** - A compression format that uses the [zlib][zlib] structure
      with the [deflate][deflate] compression algorithm.
    * **br** - a compression format that uses the [Brotli][brotli] algorithm.
    * **identity** - the identity function without modification or compression
      used to indicate unchanged responses. This value is always considered as
      acceptable, even if omitted.

    **Note:** the original media/content type is specified in the
    **Content-Type**-header, while the **Content-Encoding** applies to the
    representation of the data. If the original media is encoded in some way,
    e.g. as a zip file, then this information is not be included in the
    **Content-Encoding** header.

ETag:
  name: ETag
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **ETag** header field in a response provides an opaque quoted string
    identifying the distinct delivered resource. The same selected resource
    depending on version and representation may be identified by multiple
    identifiers. The **ETag** value is guaranteed to change whenever the
    resource changes, and thereby enabling optimistic updates.

    An identifier consists of an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by
    a weakness indicator. See [RFC 9110 Section 8.8.3][rfc-9110-8.8.3] as
    well as [API Guideline Rule #182][api-182] for further details.

Cache-Control:
  name: Cache-Control
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Cache-Control** header field is providing directives to control how
    proxies and clients are allowed to cache responses results for performance.
    Clients and proxies are free to not support caching of results, however if
    they do, they must obey all directives mentioned in [RFC-9111 Section
    5.2][rfc-9111-5.2] to the word.

    In case of caching, the directive provides the scope of the cache entry,
    i.e. only for the original user (private) or shared between all users
    (public), the lifetime of the cache entry in seconds (max-age), and the
    strategy how to handle a stale cache entry (must-revalidate). Please note,
    that the lifetime and validation directives for shared caches are different
    (s-maxage, proxy-revalidate).

    See [RFC 9111 Section 5.2][rfc-9111-5.2] as well as [API Guideline Rule
    #227][api-227] for further details.

Vary:
  name: Vary
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Vary** header field in the response describes which parts of the
    request message, aside from the method, the **Host** header field, and the
    request target path, might have influence the server in selecting the
    presented response. A client or proxy that caches the response must respect
    this information to ensure that it delivers the correct cache entry (see
    [RFC-9110 Section 12.5.5][rfc-9110-12.5.5]).

    The value consists of either a single **\*** (asterisk ) or a list of
    case-insensitive header field names.

Deprecation:
  name: Deprecation
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Deprecation** response header (see [RFC 9745][rfc-9745]) announces
    an upcoming deprecation of a feature or resource. The deprecation value is
    either a timestamp as defined in [RFC 9651 Section 3.3.7][rfc-9651-3.3.7]
    or `true` - if the feature is already deprecated.

    The scope of the distinct deprecated feature or resource must be derived
    from the API spec. If the timestamp points to the past, the API spec also
    contains a migration advise.

    Clients should monitor the usage of **Deprecation** headers and notify
    about them in time, so that migration measures can be planned and executed
    timely (see also [API Guideline - Deprecation][api]).

Sunset:
  name: Sunset
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The **Sunset** response header (see [RFC 8594][rfc-8594]) communicates the
    point in time at which the feature or resource becomes unresponsive. The
    sunset value is providing a timestamp as defined in [RFC 9110 Section
    5.6.7][rfc-9110-5.6.7] usually pointing to the future. If a sunset value
    points to the past, the feature or resource must be expected to become
    unavailable at any time.

    Clients should monitor the usage of **Sunset** headers and warn/alert about
    them before the sunset time has come to take counter measures, e.g. prepare
    a client shutdown or migration (see also [API Guideline -
    Deprecation][api-deprecation]).
