# Standard Headers

If-Match:
  name: If-Match
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The `If-Match` header field is used to declare a list of identifiers that
    are required to match the current resource version identifier in at least
    one position as a pre-condition for executing the request on the server
    side. This behavior is used to validate and reject optimistic updates, by
    checking if the resource version a consumer has based his changes on is
    outdated on arrival of the change request to prevent lost updates.

    If the pre-condition fails the server will respond with status code `412`
    (Precondition Failed). For further details see [RFC 7232 Section
    3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.1).

  explode: false

If-None-Match:
  name: If-None-Match
  in: header
  required: false
  description: |-
    The `If-None-Match header` field is used to declare a list of identifiers
    that are required to fail matching all the current resource version
    identifiers as a pre-condition for executing the request on the server
    side. This is especially used in conjunction with an `*` (asterix) that is
    matching all possible resource identifiers to ensure the initial creation
    of a resource. Other use cases are possible but rare.

    If the pre-condition fails the server will respond with status code `412`
    (Precondition Failed). For further details see [RFC 7232 Section
    3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.2) for further details.
