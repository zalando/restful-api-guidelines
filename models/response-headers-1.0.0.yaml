# Standard Headers

Cache-Control:
  in: header
  name: Cache-Control
  description: |
    The `Cache-Control` header field is providing directives to control how
    proxies and clients are allowed to cache responses results for performance.
    Clients and proxies are free to not support caching of results, however if
    they do, they must obey all directives mentioned in [RFC-9111 Section
    5.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111#name-response-directives) to the word.

    In case of caching, the directive provides the scope of the cache entry,
    i.e. only for the original user (private) or shared between all users
    (public), the lifetime of the cache entry in seconds (max-age), and the
    strategy how to handle a stale cache entry (must-revalidate). Please note,
    that the lifetime and validation directives for shared caches are different
    (s-maxage, proxy-revalidate).
  schema:
    type: string
    example: "private,must-revalidate,max-age=3600"

Vary:
  in: header
  name: Vary
  description: |
    The `Vary` header field in the response describes which parts of the
    request message, aside from the method, the `Host` header field, and the
    request target path, might have influence the server in selecting the
    presented response. A client or proxy that caches the response must respect
    this information to ensure that it delivers the correct cache entry (see
    [RFC 9110 Section 12.5.5. Vary](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-vary)
    and [RFC 9111 Section 4.1 Calculating Cache Keys with the Vary Header Field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111#name-calculating-cache-keys-with)).

    The value consists of either a single asterisk (`*`) or a list of
    case-insensitive header field names.
  schema:
    type: string
    example: "accept-encoding,accept-language"

ETag:
  in: header
  name: ETag
  description: >
    The `ETag` header field in a response provides an opaque quoted string
    identifying the distinct delivered resource. The same selected resource
    depending on version and representation may be identified by multiple
    identifiers. The `ETag` value is guaranteed to change whenever the
    resource changes, and thereby enabling optimistic updates.

    An identifier consists of an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by
    a weakness indicator. For further details see [RFC 9110 Section
    8.8.3. ETag](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-etag) and
    [RFC 9111 Section 4.3.1 Sending a Validation Request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111#name-sending-a-validation-reques)
  schema:
    type: string
    example: 'W/"xy", "5", "5db68c06-1a68-11e9-8341-68f728c1ba70"''

# Custom Headers

X-Flow-ID:
  name: X-Flow-ID
  description: |
    The `X-Flow-ID` is a custom header containing a unique flow identifier that
    was be passed to any further request. It can be used to investigate request
    related log entries end events.
  in: header
  schema:
    type: string
    example: GKY7oDhpSiKY_gAAAABZ_A
